This week is dedicated to UX Testing, a critical phase in the design lifecycle where design concepts and prototypes are evaluated with real users. After ideating and developing initial solutions ([[Week 04 - Design Principles & Ideation]], [[Week 05 - Wireframing & Prototyping]]), testing helps to uncover usability issues, validate design decisions, and ensure that the product meets user needs and expectations. This aligns with the "Test & Learn" part of the "Deliver" phase in the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]].

The lecture will differentiate between concept testing and usability testing, outline the testing process (plan, prepare, moderate, outcomes), discuss hypothesis generation and testing, and introduce methods for measuring usability, such as the System Usability Scale (SUS) and its variants (UMUX, UMUX Lite).

## Key Topics for Week 7

This week's content is broken down into the following key areas:

* [[W7 - Why Test & Introduction to Testing Types]]: Understanding the importance of early and continuous testing, and distinguishing between concept testing and usability testing.
* [[W7 - Concept Testing]]: Exploring methods to evaluate the core value proposition and sense-making of a solution with target customers early in the design process.
* [[W7 - Usability Testing]]: Focusing on more rigorous evaluative testing to identify usability problems, discover opportunities for improvement, and learn about user behavior with a more developed prototype. This includes moderated and unmoderated approaches.
* [[W7 - The Testing Process]]: Detailing the steps involved in preparing for and conducting testing: Plan (objectives, hypotheses), Prepare (recruitment, discussion guide), Moderate (facilitation techniques), and Outcomes (data collection, synthesis).
* [[W7 - Hypothesis Generation and Testing]]: Learning how to formulate testable hypotheses to validate assumptions about user behavior and design effectiveness.
* [[W7 - Measuring Usability]]: Introducing quantitative measures for usability, such as the System Usability Scale (SUS), Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX), and UMUX-Lite.

## Assignment Focus
* **Mid-Term Reflection:** Due this week (Monday 5 pm). This is a personal reflection on learning highlights, areas for further exploration, and group work experiences.
* **Individual Assignment:** The concepts of hypothesis generation, usability testing, and measuring usability are highly relevant for the individual assignment, where students will need to test their prototypes.
* **Tutorial P&P:** Continued emphasis on participation and preparation, with a reminder to seek feedback from tutors on areas for improvement.
