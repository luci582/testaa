In UX testing, hypotheses are specific, testable predictions or assumptions made about user behavior, preferences, or the effectiveness of a design. Generating and testing hypotheses provides a structured way to validate ideas, measure outcomes, and make data-driven design decisions. This is a core activity within the [[W7 - The Testing Process|planning phase of testing]].

## What is a Hypothesis in UX Testing?

* **Definition:** An assumption or prediction you have *prior* to running an experiment, [[W7 - Usability Testing|usability test]], or [[W7 - Concept Testing|concept test]]. It's a statement about what you expect to happen or observe.
* **Purpose:**
    * To guide the testing process by focusing on specific aspects to evaluate.
    * To provide a framework for measuring the success or failure of a design change or concept.
    * To facilitate learning by explicitly stating and then testing assumptions.

## Key Characteristics of a Good Hypothesis

* **Measurable Outcome:** The predicted outcome of the experiment or test should be quantifiable or observable in a clear way.
* **Testable:** It must be possible to design a test or experiment that can confirm or refute the hypothesis.
* **Manages Risks:** Helps to validate ideas and determine whether to proceed with a design direction, thereby managing the risk of building ineffective solutions.
* **Explicitly Captured Learning:** Provides invaluable data that can be used for future design decisions, whether the hypothesis is supported or not.
* **Simple and Clear:** Easy to understand.
* **Specific:** Not vague; clearly defines the variable being changed and the expected effect.

## Characteristics of a Bad Hypothesis

* **Untestable:** No clear way to measure or observe the outcome.
* **Vague:** Lacks precision.
* **Non-directional:** Doesn't predict a specific outcome or change.
* **Non-existent (Variable):** Doesn't specify what is being changed or tested.

## Developing Hypotheses: Identifying Assumptions

Before formulating a hypothesis, it's important to write down all the assumptions you have about:

* **User Understanding:**
    * How users might understand certain design concepts.
    * Their familiarity with navigation menus, buttons, or other UI elements.
* **Relevance/Appeal of Features:**
    * Whether users will enjoy or find value in specific features or functions.
    * How different user types (e.g., based on [[W3 - Personas|personas]]) might find certain aspects valuable.
    * *Example Assumption:* "Users enjoy X features on apps," or "Our target audience prefers an engaging experience over a simple one."

## Hypothesis Recipe/Structure

A common way to structure a hypothesis for UX testing is:

**"We believe that** `[issue / problem / obstacle]`**,**
**So if we** `[change this variable / implement this solution]`**,**
**We will see** `[predict the outcome / measurable result]`**."**

* **`[Issue / problem / obstacle]`:** The user problem or current challenge you've identified.
* **`[Change this variable / implement this solution]`:** The specific design change, feature, or element you are introducing or testing. This needs to be a specific design element.
* **`[Predict the outcome / measurable result]`:** The expected impact on user behavior or perception, which should be measurable.

## Examples of Hypotheses

*(Based on lecture slides)*

**Hypothesis 1: Understanding Customer Attitudes (Insurance Payment)**
* **We believe that** customers assume they save money if they pay annually for their insurance.
* **So if we** inform them (e.g., via a notification banner) that there is no difference in total price regardless of how they pay,
* **We will see** more customers paying monthly since it aligns with their pay cycle and other bills.
    * **Related Research Questions:**
        * How often do you pay for your insurance policy and why?
        * Do you assume there's a difference in price depending on how you pay?
        * What is your preferred payment frequency with the knowledge that there is no difference in total price and why?
    * **Potential Measures:** Proportion of customers choosing monthly payments after seeing the information.

**Hypothesis 2: Testing Ease of Use (Insurance Payment Calculation)**
* **We believe that** customers want to calculate how much they need to pay each month vs. each year before making a purchasing decision.
* **So if we** include a dropdown menu which dynamically changes the price display,
* **We will see** that customers can easily see how much they will need to pay for the year or each month.
    * **Related Research Questions:**
        * How would you go about calculating how much you'd be paying each month vs. year?
        * How did you feel figuring out how to complete the task?
        * On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to complete the task?
    * **Potential Measures:** Task completion rate, self-reported ease of use score.

**Hypothesis 3: A/B Testing (Price Breakdown Clarity)**
* **We believe that** customers want to see a breakdown of what they're paying for.
* **So if we** clearly list out each line item and price per period (Version A) versus showing just a total price (Version B),
* **We will see** that customers prefer seeing a price breakdown over seeing just a total price.
    * **Related Research Questions:**
        * Which version do you like more?
        * What would you rate each version for clarity (out of 5)?
        * Why do you like your chosen version more?
        * Why didn't you like the other version?
    * **Potential Measures:** Preference for Version A/B, clarity ratings for each version.

Formulating clear, testable hypotheses is a key part of planning effective UX testing. It ensures that testing efforts are focused and that the results can provide actionable insights for design improvement. This is a vital skill for the individual assignment.
