Usability testing is a more rigorous form of evaluative testing compared to [[W7 - Concept Testing|concept testing]]. It typically occurs closer to the final completion of development, using more refined (often interactive) [[W5 - Prototyping|prototypes]] or even the actual product before it's released to the market. Its primary goal is to identify and finetune usability issues by observing real users as they attempt to complete tasks with the product.

## What is Usability Testing?

* **Definition:** A method for evaluating how easy a design is to use by testing it with representative users. Users are typically asked to complete tasks while observers watch, listen, and take notes.
* **Timing:** Happens later in the development cycle, nearer to product completion.
* **Rigor:** Involves a more structured approach, often with specific tasks and [[W7 - Measuring Usability|metrics]] to assess performance.
* **Purpose:**
    * To identify specific usability problems in the design.
    * To fine-tune interactions and workflows.
    * To measure and compare the usability of a design against benchmarks or previous versions.
    * To learn about users' actual behavior and preferences when interacting with a more complete design.

## Why Conduct Usability Testing?

* **Uncover Problems in the Design:** Identify specific areas where users struggle, get confused, or cannot complete tasks efficiently.
* **Discover Opportunities to Improve:** Pinpoint areas where the design can be made more intuitive, efficient, or satisfying.
* **Learn About User Behavior and Preferences:** Observe how users actually interact with the system, which can often differ from what they self-report or what designers assume.

## Core Elements of Usability Testing

1.  **Facilitator (Moderator):**
    * **Role:** Guides the participant through the test process, provides instructions, observes behavior, asks non-leading questions, and collects feedback.
    * **Key Skills:** Ability to build rapport, remain neutral, probe effectively, and manage the session.
2.  **Tasks:**
    * **Definition:** Realistic activities that the participant might perform in real life using the product or service being studied.
    * **Importance:** Tasks provide a structured way to observe user interactions and assess how well the design supports goal completion. (More on task design in [[W7 - The Testing Process]]).
3.  **Participant:**
    * **Definition:** A realistic user of the product or service being studied. Participants should represent the target audience.
    * **Role:** Performs the assigned tasks and provides feedback on their experience.

**Flow of Information in Usability Testing:**
* The **Facilitator** administers tasks to the **Participant**.
* The **Participant** performs the tasks using the product.
* The **Facilitator** observes the Participant's behavior and interviews them (asks questions).
* The **Participant** gives feedback to the Facilitator.

## Types of Usability Testing Sessions

### 1. Moderated Testing
* **Definition:** A researcher (facilitator/moderator) is present with the participant, either in person or remotely (e.g., via video conference).
* **Process:** The moderator provides instructions, observes the participant in real-time as they perform tasks, and can ask follow-up or clarifying questions.
* **Activities:** Can include [[W2 - User Interviews|interviews]] (often before and after tasks), focus groups (less common for detailed usability testing but can be used for broader feedback), role-playing, and concept/prototype walkthroughs.
* **Tools:** For remote moderated testing, tools like Askable, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Google Hangouts are used.
* **Pros:** Allows for direct observation of behavior and non-verbal cues, ability to probe deeper and ask spontaneous follow-up questions, can provide richer qualitative insights.
* **Cons:** Can be more time-consuming and expensive per participant, potential for moderator bias if not careful.

### 2. Unmoderated Testing
* **Definition:** Participants complete tasks on their own, without a facilitator present in real-time. Instructions and tasks are typically delivered via a software application or online platform, which also records their actions and can ask predetermined questions.
* **Process:** Users interact with the system, and their screen activity, clicks, and sometimes audio/video are recorded. They might answer survey-style questions or provide written/verbal feedback at predefined points.
* **Activities:** Online [[W2 - Quantitative Research Methods#1 Card Sorting|card sorting]], online task-based tests, online click tests, Information Architecture (IA) testing (e.g., using Treejack).
* **Tools:** Platforms like Maze, UserTesting.com, Optimal Workshop.
* **Pros:** Can test with a larger number of participants more quickly and cost-effectively, can be done asynchronously at the participant's convenience, useful for collecting quantitative data (e.g., task success rates, time on task).
* **Cons:** No opportunity for real-time clarification or follow-up questions from a moderator, might miss nuanced behavioral insights, relies heavily on the clarity of instructions.

**Example Videos from Lecture:**
* The lecture showcased a moderated usability test for the Ryanair app, where a facilitator guided a participant through booking a flight.
* An unmoderated test example showed a participant interacting with Gmail, receiving prompts from the software, and thinking aloud. This highlighted how user confusion and thought processes can be captured even without a live moderator.

Both moderated and unmoderated usability testing play important roles in identifying design flaws and gathering user feedback to create more effective and user-friendly products. The choice between them often depends on research goals, budget, timeline, and the type of insights sought.
