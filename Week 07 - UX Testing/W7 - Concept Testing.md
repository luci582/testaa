Concept testing is an early-stage UX research method aimed at evaluating the fundamental idea, value proposition, and overall "sense-making" of a design solution with its target audience. It occurs before significant development effort is invested, focusing on refining and validating core concepts quickly.

## What is Concept Testing?

* **Definition:** A process of getting user feedback on an idea or concept *before* it is fully designed or developed. It aims to ensure that the proposed solution is understandable, makes sense to the target customers, and aligns with a current, genuine need.
* **Timing:** Happens at earlier stages of the design and development lifecycle, often when ideas are still in a low-to-medium fidelity state (e.g., sketches, [[W5 - Wireframes|wireframes]], [[W4 - Ideation Techniques#Storyboarding in UX|storyboards]], early [[W5 - Prototyping|prototypes]]).
* **Goal:**
    * To gather initial reactions to a proposed solution.
    * To identify potential flaws or areas of confusion in the core concept.
    * To understand if the concept resonates with the target audience and addresses their needs.
    * To refine ideas quickly and "fail forward and fast," meaning learning from early failures to improve the concept incrementally.

## Why Do We Conduct Concept Testing?

* **Evaluate the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) & Value Proposition:**
    * Test if the core offering provides perceived value to the users.
    * Understand what makes the product stand out or why users would choose it.
* **Prevent Bad Ideas from Progressing:** Identify and discard unviable or poorly received concepts early on, saving time and resources.
* **Refine Good Ideas & Improve the Solution:** Gather feedback to improve aspects like:
    * **Labels and Terminology:** Are they clear and understandable?
    * **Positioning:** Is the product/feature positioned effectively to meet user needs?
    * **Navigation Concepts:** Do initial navigation ideas make sense to users?
* **Early User Validation:** Confirms whether you are on the right track with your design direction by getting feedback directly from the intended users. It helps ensure that the problem being solved is relevant and the proposed solution is appropriate.

## How is Concept Testing Conducted?

Concept testing can be carried out using various qualitative research techniques, often leveraging skills from [[W2 - User Interviews|user interviews]] and [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research|workshops]]. The key is to present the concept to users and gather their feedback.

* **Structure Introduced:**
    * **[[W7 - Hypothesis Generation and Testing|Hypothesis-driven learning]]:** Formulate assumptions about user understanding, appeal of features, or value, and then test these assumptions.
    * **[[W7 - The Testing Process#Participant Snapshots|Participant Snapshots]]:** While [[W3 - Personas|personas]] represent user groups, snapshots can capture details about individual participants in the testing session. (The lecture mentions personas for individual assignments and participant snapshots in the context of testing).
    * **Scenarios & Task-Oriented Instructions:** Present users with scenarios or ask them to imagine performing tasks related to the concept to see how they would interact with it or what they would expect.
* **What Can Be Used for Concept Testing?**
    * **[[W5 - Wireframes|Wireframes]] or Mock-ups:** Static representations of screen layouts.
    * **Early [[W5 - Prototyping|Prototypes]]:** Low to medium-fidelity interactive models.
    * **[[W4 - Ideation Techniques#Storyboarding in UX|Storyboards]]:** Visual narratives showing a user's interaction with the concept.
    * **Service Blueprints:** (To be covered in [[INFS 3700 ai/Week 09 - Blueprinting/Week 09 - Service Blueprinting]]) For testing service concepts.
* **Key Considerations for Test Materials:**
    * Ensure they are well-designed enough to clearly demonstrate the solution/concept.
    * Materials should be tidy, approachable, and easy for participants to understand.

## Iterative Learning in Concept Testing

* It's common for designers to update or iterate on their design concepts *between* concept testing sessions based on the feedback received.
* This "fail forward and fast" approach allows for rapid, incremental learning and improvement of the solution before more detailed design or development work begins.

Concept testing is a valuable early checkpoint in the design process that helps to ensure that the team is building the right solution for the right users by validating the core idea and its perceived value.
