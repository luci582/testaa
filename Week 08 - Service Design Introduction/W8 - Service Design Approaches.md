Service Design, much like [[W1 - The Design Process|UX design]], employs structured approaches to understand, create, and improve service experiences. These approaches often incorporate established methodologies like the Double Diamond and Design Thinking, always with a human-centered focus.

## Applying the Double Diamond to Service Design

The [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]] model is a common framework for navigating service design projects:

* **First Diamond (Understanding the Current State & Defining the Problem):**
    * **[[W1 - The Design Process#Discover Problem Space - Diverge |Discover]]:** In service design, the initial focus is on understanding and mapping the *current state* of the service ecosystem. This involves research into user needs, stakeholder perspectives, existing processes, and touchpoints.
    * **[[W1 - The Design Process#Define Problem Space - Converge |Define]]:** Synthesize research findings to pinpoint key problems, pain points, and opportunities within the current service. This leads to a clear definition of the service design challenge.
* **Second Diamond (Developing and Delivering the Solution - Target State):**
    * **[[W1 - The Design Process#Develop Solution Space - Diverge |Develop]]:** Pinpoint opportunities and find solutions for how best to get to an improved or new service. This involves ideating and exploring various concepts for the *target state* (the desired future experience).
    * **[[W1 - The Design Process#DeliverTest Solution Space - Converge |Deliver]]:** Prototype, test, and iterate on service concepts. This phase focuses on orchestrating the various components (people, processes, props, etc.) to deliver the intended value.

**The Design Squiggle in Service Design:**
The [[W1 - The Design Process#4 1 The Design Squiggle|design squiggle]] also applies, representing the journey from uncertainty and abstract understanding of a complex service to clarity and a focused, validated solution. The process involves: Research → Insights → Design & Test → Solve & Validate → Execute.

## Integrating Design Thinking

[[W1 - The Design Process#3 Design Thinking Framework e g IDEO s 5 Stages|Design Thinking]] is a human-centered approach to innovation that is central to service design.

* **Tim Brown (CEO of IDEO) Definition:** "Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success."
* **Action-Oriented:** It involves a hands-on approach to create real value for businesses, focusing on innovation based on customer and stakeholder input.
* **Iterative Problem Solving:** Helps design practitioners resolve challenges through iterative means (prototyping, testing, learning).

## The DVF (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility) Framework in Service Design

The [[W1 - The Design Process#4 DVF Venn Diagram Desirability Viability Feasibility|DVF framework]] is critical for ensuring that service innovations are balanced and sustainable. The "innovation sweet spot" lies at the intersection of these three criteria.

* **Desirability (Users/Customers):**
    * Does the service meet a real customer need or desire?
    * Who are the users? Why do they use the service? Where does it fit in their lives?
* **Viability (Business):**
    * Does the service make business sense? Is there a sustainable business model?
    * What is the business need? What are the organizational drivers and stakeholder landscape? What are the budget or other constraints?
* **Feasibility (Technology/Operations):**
    * Can the service be delivered effectively with current or attainable capabilities?
    * What are the technology limitations? What are the policy or legal limitations?

Building a balanced understanding across these three areas is crucial for successful service design. Service Designers use research and design tools and techniques to help businesses place stakeholders (especially customers) at the center of their service offering, thereby uncovering new forms of growth and value.

Service design approaches aim to be:
* **Human-centered:** Considering the experience of all people affected by the service.
* **Collaborative:** Actively engaging stakeholders from various backgrounds.
* **Iterative:** Employing an exploratory, adaptive, and experimental approach.
* **Sequential:** Recognizing that services unfold over time and need to be logically and visually mapped.
* **Holistic:** Considering both tangible and intangible elements and all touchpoints.

These approaches enable service designers to not only improve existing services but also to envision and create entirely new ones that are more effective, efficient, and desirable.
