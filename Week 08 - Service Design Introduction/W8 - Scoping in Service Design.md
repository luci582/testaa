Scoping is a critical initial phase in any service design project. It occurs at the outset, within the "Discover" and leading into the "Define" phase of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]]. Scoping involves thoroughly exploring and defining the business problem, understanding the project's drivers, agreeing on what is included (and excluded), and aligning with client or stakeholder expectations.

## What is Scoping in Service Design?

* **Definition:** The process of investigating the initial business problem or opportunity that a service design project aims to address. It involves discussions with the client or internal stakeholders to understand the context, goals, constraints, and desired outcomes.
* **Timing:** Occurs at the very beginning of a project, often as part of a kick-off workshop.
* **Purpose:**
    * To clearly define the service design challenge and its area of focus.
    * To download existing knowledge from key stakeholders.
    * To co-create a shared understanding of the project's parameters with the client/stakeholders.
    * To define what is "in scope" (will be addressed by the project) and "out of scope" (will not be addressed).
    * To shape the [[W8 - Scoping in Service Design#Developing the Project Brief|Project Brief]], which guides the entire project.

## The Importance of Scoping Workshops (Kick-off Workshops)

Kick-off workshops are often used for scoping and help in:

* **Understanding Client's Goals:** Clarifying what the client or business aims to achieve.
* **Mapping the Current Environment:** Getting an initial understanding of the context, including PEST (Political, Economic, Social, Technological) factors if relevant.
* **Surfacing Existing Research:** Identifying any prior research or data that can inform the project.
* **Calling Out Assumptions and Risks:** Making explicit any underlying assumptions and potential risks associated with the project.
* **Defining the "Funnel of Scope":** Gradually narrowing down from a broad problem area to a more specific and manageable project scope.

## Key Areas of Focus During Scoping

To properly determine the scope, the team needs to work with the client/stakeholders to address:

* **Problem/Opportunity:** What is the perceived problem or opportunity the project should tackle?
* **Context:** What is the broader environment in which this problem/opportunity exists?
* **Target Audience:** Who are the primary users or customers the service aims to serve?
* **Vision & Ambition:** What is the overall vision for the project? What level of change or impact is desired? (e.g., designing a single touchpoint vs. redesigning an entire service system).
* **Stakeholder Alignment:** Understanding the landscape of stakeholders, their interests, motivations, and potential influence on the project.
* **Constraints:** Identifying limitations such as budget, timeline, technology, or policies.

## Setting the Scope: Key Questions

* Who is the client, and what do they fundamentally need?
* Who is their target audience or market?
* Who are their competitors?
* What are they trying to achieve (project goals)?
* What is their budget?
* How would they like to engage throughout the project?
* Who are the other relevant stakeholders?
* What is the precise scope of this project (what's in, what's out)?

The "Zoom Level" (from the lecture slide) helps illustrate the varying ambition/complexity:
* **One Action / Touchpoint Design (Single Channel):** Very focused.
* **One Process / Service Design (Single Channel):** Broader.
* **One Experience / Service Design (Multi-Channel):** Even broader.
* **Channel Strategy / Experience Strategy:** Higher-level strategic work.
* **Organizational Design / Service Strategy:** Affecting the whole organization.
* **System Design / System Service Strategy:** Involving multiple organizations.

The complexity increases as the scope moves from single-channel touchpoint design to multi-organizational system strategy.

## Mapping Stakeholders

* **Purpose:** To identify all individuals, groups, or organizations that have an interest in or can be affected by the service design project.
* **Techniques:** Various stakeholder mapping techniques exist. A common approach is to categorize stakeholders (e.g., based on their level of involvement or influence).
* **Example Categories (from lecture slide):**
    * **Core Team:** Directly involved in doing the work.
    * **Involved Stakeholders:** Need to be consulted and actively participate at key points.
    * **Informed Stakeholders:** Need to be kept updated on progress and decisions.
* **Benefit:** Helps understand who to engage for reporting, collaboration, information, and potentially who to manage carefully if their interests conflict with project goals. This can be focused internally within an organization or include the broader client landscape.

## Developing the Project Brief

The scoping process culminates in the creation of a Project Brief.

* **What is it?** A structured, often one-page, summary that clarifies the fundamental challenge or problem to be addressed. It outlines business intent, aspirations, goals/objectives, obstacles, practical approach, potential project team, constraints, budgets, and timelines.
* **Why use it?** To ensure all project participants and stakeholders have a clear, shared understanding of the project parameters and are aligned with its purpose.
* **How to use it (Create it):** Often best generated through a co-design session with project owners, key stakeholders, and the project team.
* **Key Sections in a Project Brief (The 5 Ps of a Brief - different from the 5Ps of Service Design):**
    * **Purpose:**
        * Why is this project being undertaken?
        * What goals/objectives for the organization and its customers?
        * How big is the opportunity?
    * **Performance:**
        * Are there specific measures the organization aims to achieve?
    * **People:**
        * What does the business owner want to achieve?
        * Who are the users (internal/external)?
        * Who makes up the project team and who are key stakeholders?
    * **Place:**
        * Where will customers experience the service? List scenarios.
        * Is there a dedicated collaborative workspace (physical or client site)?
    * **Problems (and Resources):**
        * What are known/assumed problems with the current service?
        * What resources are needed for success? Have they been procured?
        * What are known/assumed obstacles or limitations?
        * List risk factors, strengths/weaknesses, and related dependencies.

Effective scoping is foundational for a successful service design project, ensuring that the team is solving the right problem for the right people, with clear objectives and a shared understanding among all involved.
