This week introduces the discipline of Service Design (SD), marking a transition from the more focused User Experience (UX) design covered in previous weeks. Service Design takes a broader, more holistic view, choreographing processes, technologies, and interactions within complex systems to co-create value for all relevant stakeholders. It considers the entire ecosystem of a service, including both front-stage (customer-facing) and back-stage (internal operational) elements.

The lecture will cover the definition and history of service design, differentiate it from product design and further clarify its relationship with UX and Customer Experience (CX). We will explore various service design approaches, the importance of scoping in service design projects, and the "5Ps of Service Design" framework.

## Key Topics for Week 8

This week's content is structured around the following key areas:

* [[W8 - What is Service Design]]: Defining service design, its historical evolution, distinguishing services from products, and understanding the philosophy and methodology of service design. This section will also revisit the relationship between UX, SD, and CX, and clarify what service design is *not*.
* [[W8 - Service Design Approaches]]: Examining how service design is practiced, often following the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]] process, and integrating [[W1 - The Design Process#3 Design Thinking Framework e g IDEO s 5 Stages|Design Thinking]]. The importance of the [[W1 - The Design Process#4 DVF Venn Diagram Desirability Viability Feasibility|DVF (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility)]] framework in achieving innovation will also be reinforced.
* [[W8 - Scoping in Service Design]]: Understanding the critical initial step of scoping a service design challenge, which involves defining the business problem, project parameters, and stakeholder landscape, often through kick-off workshops, leading to a project brief.
* [[W8 - The 5Ps of Service Design]]: Introducing a framework (People, Processes, Places, Products, Performance) used in the early discovery phase to map out and understand the various components of a service ecosystem.
