The 5Ps of Service Design is a framework used in the early "Discover" stage of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]] to map out and understand the various components and touchpoints that constitute a service ecosystem. It helps service designers get a sense of the boundaries of the service they are working with and to identify all aspects that contribute to the user's experience.

## Understanding the 5Ps Framework

To create a "lovable" service experience, service designers aim to define and understand "The 5Ps": People, Processes, Places, Products, and Performance. This technique helps to set the trajectory for research and understand the ecosystem from a holistic perspective.

By identifying and unpacking these 5Ps, designers can map all touchpoints and interactions a business has with its staff, customers, tangible products, and intangible spaces and experiences. Each of these touchpoints must come together effectively to meet the end users' needs.

### 1. People
This "P" is about understanding everyone involved in or affected by the service. It emphasizes the human element of service delivery and consumption.

* **Customers & Users:**
    * **Service Users/Customers:** People who purchase or commission the service. They may or may not be the person actually using the service directly.
    * **End Users:** Those who directly interact with the service to achieve an outcome (e.g., an employee booking travel for their manager; the manager is the customer, the employee is the user of the booking service).
* **Employees:**
    * **Front of House (Front-Stage) Staff:** Employees who deliver the service directly to the user and are visible to them (e.g., help desk staff, reservations agents, retail assistants).
    * **Back of House (Back-Stage) Staff:** Employees who don't often interact directly with service users but are essential to the service experience (e.g., baggage handlers for an airline, kitchen staff in a restaurant, IT support maintaining systems).
* **Partners:**
    * Other individuals or organizations involved in delivering parts of the overall service experience.
    * *Examples:* An airline partnering with a limo service for airport transfers; a hotel using third-party transfer operators.

### 2. Processes
This "P" focuses on the workflows, routines, procedures, and systems that enable the service to function.

* **Operations:**
    * The current processes, policies, and procedures that teams use to enable a service outcome.
    * Includes official workflows as well as informal workarounds people might use to "get the job done."
* **Systems:**
    * Technical systems used by customers, users, staff, or partners as part of the service experience (e.g., booking systems, CRM software, payment gateways, internal databases).

### 3. Places
This "P" considers the physical and digital environments where services are created, delivered, and experienced.

* **Touchpoints (Physical/Digital Environments):**
    * Physical locations like a store, a kiosk, a check-in counter, a clinic.
    * Digital environments like a website, a mobile app, an online portal.
* **Workspaces:**
    * The physical or digital environments where employees perform their service functions. The design of these workspaces can affect the quality of service delivery.
    * Observing how people use space is important.
* **In Between (The "Third Place" or Transitional Spaces):**
    * Considers that customers are often on the move and expect to stay connected to services. This relates to understanding the user's context and journey between distinct touchpoints.
    * Addresses questions like "Where am I?" or "Where is my thing (e.g., a delivery)?"

### 4. Products (Props/Artifacts)
This "P" refers to the tangible objects, tools, and collateral used to inform, support, or deliver the service. These are often the "props" in the service experience.

* **Digital Products/Touchpoints:**
    * Can be interactive touchpoints (e.g., apps, websites, kiosks) used for both service functions and communication.
* **Analog Products:**
    * Physical, often printed materials such as brochures, forms, posters, booklets, business cards, tickets, packaging.
* **Spatial Products/Elements:**
    * Anything in the physical environment that supports the customer experience in the absence of direct staff assistance.
    * *Examples:* Signage, interactive kiosks (can also be digital), wayfinding systems, ambiance-setting elements like lighting or furniture.

### 5. Performance
This "P" is about how the service is measured and perceived in terms of its quality, effectiveness, and value.

* **Nature:** It's often the least tangible of the 5Ps and sits across all the others.
* **Measurement:** The performance of any given process, person, place, or product can be measured in different ways:
    * **Quantitative Metrics:** Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the business (e.g., customer satisfaction scores (CSAT), net promoter score (NPS), task completion rates, efficiency metrics, revenue).
    * **Qualitative Aspects:** Can also be measured by emotions (e.g., delight, frustration, confidence) or how valuable the service is perceived to be by an individual.
* **Driving Quality:** Performance measures drive the quality of the service provided and help identify areas for improvement.

By systematically examining a service through the lens of these 5Ps, service designers can gain a comprehensive understanding of its current state, identify all relevant touchpoints and interactions, and pinpoint areas for research, innovation, and improvement. This holistic view is essential for designing services that are truly user-centered and effective.
