Once user problems have been identified and framed (see [[W3 - Problem Framing|Problem Framing]]), and potential ideas or features start to emerge, prioritization becomes essential. Not all problems can be solved at once, and not all features can be built immediately. Prioritization helps teams make informed decisions about where to focus their efforts based on various criteria.

## Why is Prioritization Necessary?

* **Limited Resources:** Teams always operate with constraints on time, budget, and personnel.
* **Focus:** Helps to concentrate efforts on what will deliver the most value or address the most critical issues.
* **Decision Making:** Provides a structured way to look at data and make choices about what to work on next.
* **Scope Management:** Prevents trying to tackle too much at once ("boiling the ocean").

Prioritization can be applied to:
* **Problem spaces:** Which user problems are most critical to address?
* **Solution or feature ideas:** Which potential solutions or features offer the best return on investment?
* **Early concepts or ideas:** Which initial concepts are worth pursuing further?

## Criteria for Prioritization

Effective prioritization relies on defined criteria. Common criteria include:

* **User Demand/Value:** How strongly is this needed or desired by users? (Identified by user research). How much benefit will this provide to the customer?
* **Business Value/Importance:** How much will this help meet project or strategic business goals? Does it align with the company's objectives?
* **Effort/Cost to Build:** How difficult, time-consuming, or expensive will it be to implement this solution or feature?
* **Technical Feasibility:** Is it technically possible to build this with current capabilities and technology?
* **Design Feasibility:** How well does a proposed design deliver on requirements, objectives, and goals?
* **Strategic Alignment:** Does it support the organization's broader strategy?
* **Urgency/Time Sensitivity:** Are there external factors (e.g., market changes, competitor actions) that make this a high priority now?

**Connection to DVF:** Many prioritization factors align with the [[W1 - The Design Process#4 DVF Venn Diagram Desirability Viability Feasibility|DVF (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility)]] framework.
    * **Desirability:** User Demand/Value, Customer Value.
    * **Viability:** Business Value/Importance, Strategic Alignment.
    * **Feasibility:** Effort/Cost to Build, Technical Feasibility.

## Common Prioritization Frameworks and Methods

### 1. Impact/Effort Matrix (or Value/Effort Matrix)
* **Concept:** A 2x2 matrix where one axis represents the "Impact" or "Value" (to the user or business) and the other axis represents the "Effort" (to implement).
* **Quadrants:**
    * **High Impact, Low Effort (Quick Wins / Do First):** These are the most attractive items to tackle first as they provide significant value for relatively little effort.
    * **High Impact, High Effort (Major Projects / Strategic Initiatives):** These are valuable but require significant investment. They need careful planning.
    * **Low Impact, Low Effort (Fill-ins / Secondary Tasks):** Can be done if time allows, but are not critical.
    * **Low Impact, High Effort (Reconsider / Time Sinks / Avoid):** These generally offer poor return on investment and should often be avoided or deprioritized.
* **Process:**
    1.  List the items to be prioritized (problems, features, ideas).
    2.  For each item, assign a score or qualitative assessment for Impact and Effort (e.g., using a 1-5 scale, or categories like Low/Medium/High).
    3.  Plot each item on the matrix.
    4.  Discuss as a group, focusing on items in the top-right (High Impact, High Effort) and top-left (High Impact, Low Effort) quadrants.
* **Variation (Importance/Impact):** The lecture slide also shows an "Impact/Importance" graph, which can be used similarly, where "Importance" refers to business benefit and "Impact" to customer benefit.

### 2. Other Prioritization Methods (Mentioned in Slides)
The lecture slides show a visual with several other named prioritization methods, implying a variety exist. Some common ones (though not detailed in the transcript for Week 3) include:
* **MoSCoW Method:**
    * **M** - Must have (critical for launch)
    * **S** - Should have (important but not vital)
    * **C** - Could have (desirable but less important)
    * **W** - Won't have (or Wish list - for this release)
* **RICE Scoring:**
    * **R**each
    * **I**mpact
    * **C**onfidence
    * **E**ffort
* **Kano Model:** Categorizes features based on how they affect customer satisfaction (Basic Needs, Performance Needs, Delighters).
* **Dot Voting:** A quick, democratic way for a group to vote on their preferred items from a list.

## Steps to Prioritizing Problems/Features (General Approach)

1.  **List Items:** Clearly list all the problems, features, or ideas that need to be prioritized.
2.  **Define Criteria:** Agree on the criteria that will be used for evaluation (e.g., Impact, Effort, Business Value, User Value).
3.  **Evaluate Items:** Assign values or scores to each item against the chosen criteria. This can be done individually first, then discussed as a group.
4.  **Plot/Visualize (if using a matrix):** Place items onto a prioritization matrix.
5.  **Discuss and Decide:**
    * As a group, discuss the placement of items and any disagreements.
    * Flesh out understanding and thoughts.
    * Focus on a manageable number of top-priority items (e.g., 1-2 critical problems or features) to frame the next steps.
6.  **Document Rationale:** Record why certain items were prioritized over others.

Prioritization is not an exact science and often involves balancing objective data with strategic considerations and team consensus. It's an ongoing activity throughout the design and development lifecycle.
