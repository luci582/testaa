This week transitions from UX research to UX analysis, focusing on how to make sense of the data collected from users. After gathering raw data through methods like interviews and workshops (as discussed in [[Week 02 - UX Research]]), the next crucial step is to analyze and synthesize this information to extract meaningful insights that can inform design decisions. This process is central to the "Define" phase of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]].

The lecture covers techniques for distilling data, such as affinity mapping and triangulation, and methods for synthesizing research into actionable design tools like personas and customer journey maps. Finally, it touches upon problem framing and prioritization to guide the subsequent design efforts.

## Key Topics for Week 3

This week's content is broken down into the following key areas:

* [[W3 - Analysis and Synthesis in UX]]: Understanding the process of moving from raw data to actionable insights, including the concepts of sensemaking, and distinguishing between analysis and synthesis.
* [[W3 - Affinity Mapping]]: A method for organizing and grouping qualitative data (like interview quotes or observations) to identify patterns, themes, and relationships.
* [[W3 - Triangulation in Research]]: Using multiple data sources, methods, investigators, or theories to corroborate findings and increase the validity and reliability of research.
* [[W3 - Personas]]: Creating fictional, archetypal users based on research data to represent the goals, needs, motivations, and behaviors of a larger user group, helping to humanize the design focus.
* [[W3 - Customer Journey Mapping]]: Visualizing the steps, touchpoints, thoughts, and emotions a user experiences when interacting with a product or service to achieve a specific goal.
* [[W3 - Problem Framing]]: Techniques for clearly defining and articulating the core problem(s) to be solved, based on user insights, including "How Might We" statements.
* [[W3 - Prioritization Techniques]]: Methods for evaluating and prioritizing problems or potential features based on criteria like impact, effort, customer value, and business value.

## Assignment Focus
* **Workshop Plan Submission:** Due this week (Week 3, Friday, 7th March, 5 pm). This involves submitting the FigJam board containing timelines, roles, participant criteria, and the chosen 4C workshop activities. Submission is via inviting the tutor to the FigJam board.
* **Unequal Contribution:** Reminder to document and raise any concerns about unequal group contributions with the tutor and lecturer early.
