After analyzing and synthesizing user research to understand [[W1 - User Goals, Behaviour, and Context|user needs]], [[W3 - Personas|personas]], and [[W3 - Customer Journey Mapping|journeys]], the next crucial step is to clearly define the problem(s) that the design efforts will aim to solve. Problem framing is about articulating these challenges in a way that is actionable and guides the ideation process. It ensures the team is focused on solving the *right* problem.

## What is Problem Framing?

* **Definition:** The process of structuring and articulating a problem or design challenge based on insights gathered from user research. It involves looking at the problem from different angles to ensure a clear and effective statement.
* **Purpose:**
    * To provide a clear focus for the design team.
    * To ensure that solutions address actual user needs and pain points identified in research.
    * To create a shared understanding of the challenge among stakeholders.
    * To provide a framework for evaluating potential solutions ("Does this concept solve the defined problem?").
* **Level of Detail:** Crafting the right level of problem statement can take time. It's a balance between being too broad (making it hard to focus) and too narrow (prematurely limiting solutions).

## Components of a Good Problem Statement (The Five Ws)

A well-crafted problem statement often implicitly or explicitly addresses:

* **What:** A clear, brief statement of the issue.
* **Where:** What sector of the business or part of the user experience is affected?
* **Who:** Which stakeholders or [[W3 - Personas|personas]] are impacted? Whose goals are impeded?
* **When:** What is the timeframe or context in which the problem occurs?
* **Why:** Why does this problem matter? Why does it prevent users or the business from achieving goals?

**Key Principle:** Problem statements should articulate problems. If you're hinting at a solution in the problem statement, you’re doing it wrong.

## Problem Framing Syntax & Examples

Several formats can help structure problem statements:

### 1. User Story / Needs-Based Format (Similar to Stanford d.school)
This format helps to empathize with the user and clearly define their situation, motivation, and the resulting feeling.

* **Syntax:**
    * "I am... [persona/user description]"
    * "Trying to... [user's goal or task]"
    * "But... [the obstacle or problem encountered]"
    * "Because... [reason for the obstacle or deeper cause]"
    * "Which makes me feel... [emotional impact on the user]"
* **Example:**
    * "I am... a tired mum of 3"
    * "Trying to... prepare the kids for school tomorrow"
    * "But... I have run low on milk and cereal"
    * "Because... I forgot to pick it up in store (in a rush!)"
    * "Which makes me feel... like a failure as a mum!"

### 2. Job Story Based Format (Alan Klement, with addition)
Focuses on the situation, motivation, and desired outcome, with the problem introduced as a barrier.

* **Syntax:**
    * "When... [situation or trigger]"
    * "I want to... [motivation or what the user wants to achieve]"
    * "So I can... [desired outcome or benefit]"
    * "But... [the problem or obstacle preventing this]"
* **Example:**
    * "When... I realise I need milk for morning breakfast"
    * "I want to... get this delivered to my kitchen table by 6:30 am"
    * "So I can... get started with the most important meal of the day, like a boss"
    * "But... stores are closed, it's too far to walk in the rain, it's too expensive, I don’t have time, etc."

## "How Might We" (HMW) Statements

HMW statements are a powerful technique for reframing problem statements into actionable opportunities for design. They are open-ended and optimistic, encouraging a variety of solutions.

* **Purpose:** To turn challenges into opportunities for design and launch brainstorming sessions.
* **Format:** Start with "How might we..." followed by the challenge or opportunity.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Suggests that a solution is possible.
    * Allows for a variety of solutions, not suggesting a particular one.
    * Should be narrow enough to provide a frame for brainstorming but broad enough to allow for creative exploration.
* **Creating HMW Statements:**
    1.  **Start with insights/problem statements:** Look at the key findings from your research.
    2.  **Rephrase as questions:** Add "How might we" at the beginning.
        * *Example Insight:* "Users are frustrated because they can't find the 'contact us' information easily."
        * *HMW:* "How might we make it easier for users to find contact information?"
    3.  **Check for breadth:** Does the HMW allow for multiple solutions? If too narrow (e.g., "How might we put a 'contact us' button on the homepage?"), broaden it. If too broad (e.g., "How might we redesign the website?"), narrow it.
    4.  **Generate multiple HMWs:** It's common to generate several HMW questions from a single problem area to explore different facets.

## Common Problem Framing Traps to Avoid

It's easy to fall into traps that lead to poorly framed problems:

* **Anchoring:** Positioning the problem in terms of an existing idea for a solution.
    * *Example:* "Healthcare providers need a guide to new regulations so they know how it affects their jobs." (Anchors on "a guide").
* **Wish Listing:** Describing the problem as a set of desired features.
    * *Example:* "Healthcare providers need a guide to regulations, reminders to check in with patients, suggestions on how to deal with particular conditions." (Lists features).
* **Frankenstein:** Smushing two or more existing products together to imply a novel solution.
    * *Example:* "Healthcare providers need a Facebook Group & Salesforce."
* **Boiling the Ocean:** Suggesting that a single problem is actually an amalgamation of many, many different problems, making it too large to tackle.
    * *Example:* "Healthcare providers need a shared calendar, to-do list, contact list, and medical encyclopedia."
* **Amplifying Feedback:** Focusing on a specific message from a non-representative group of users.
    * *Example:* "Healthcare providers need a guide to Obamacare because some mentioned they're confused by how it affects their job." (Focuses on a specific, potentially niche, complaint).
* **Being Presumptuous:** Making assumptions about how people will behave, especially with respect to the product.
    * *Example:* "Nurses will use the software to record every check-in with patients immediately following the check-in." (Assumes behavior).

Effective problem framing sets a clear direction for the design team and is a critical bridge between understanding user needs and ideating solutions.
