Affinity mapping (also known as affinity diagramming) is a widely used method in UX to organize and make sense of large amounts of qualitative data, such as observations, interview quotes, workshop outputs (e.g., ideas on sticky notes), and user feedback. It is a bottom-up approach that helps teams collaboratively identify patterns, themes, and relationships within the data. This technique is particularly useful during the analysis phase of the [[W3 - Analysis and Synthesis in UX|sensemaking process]].

## What is Affinity Mapping?

* **Purpose:** To distill patterns and useful insights from many individual data points (quotes, observations, ideas). It helps to move from raw, unstructured data to organized themes.
* **Visualization:** It's a powerful visual tool that aids in communicating research findings and fostering shared understanding within a project team or with broader stakeholders.
* **Evolution:** Based on the KJ Method, developed by Jiro Kawakita in the 1960s.
* **Core Activity:** Grouping individual data points based on their natural relationships or "affinity."

## Why is Affinity Mapping Important?

* **Sort & Organize Research:** Provides a structured way to manage and make sense of large volumes of qualitative data.
* **Identify Themes and Pain Points:** Helps to surface recurring ideas, common problems, user needs, and significant pain points that might not be immediately obvious.
* **Communicate Observations:** Offers a visual and collaborative way to share and discuss research findings with a broader audience.
* **Drives Insight Generation:** The process of grouping and labeling data facilitates the generation of the [[W3 - Analysis and Synthesis in UX#Generating Insights|Interesting, Relevant, and Actionable (IRA) insights]].

## Affinity Mapping - Step-by-Step Process

1.  **Capture Insights (Create one insight per Post-it note):**
    * Each individual piece of data (an observation, a direct user quote, a key behavior, an idea from a brainstorm) is written on a separate physical or digital sticky note.
    * **Rule:** One idea or insight per note. This keeps each data point distinct and easy to move.
    * Data sources: [[W2 - User Interviews|User interview]] transcripts, [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research|workshop]] outputs, survey open-ended responses, [[W2 - Qualitative Research Methods#3 Observation Ethnographic Observation|observation]] notes.

2.  **Organize & Group (Cluster the insights):**
    * Team members collaboratively (or initially individually, then collaboratively) review all the sticky notes.
    * Notes that seem related or similar are grouped together to form clusters. This is done based on the natural affinity or relationship between the ideas, not predefined categories.
    * The focus is on the problem space, not potential solutions at this stage.
    * Move notes around, discuss emerging groups, and refine clusters.

3.  **Label & Title (Name each category/group):**
    * Once stable groups or clusters have formed, the team discusses the underlying theme or commonality for each group.
    * A concise, descriptive label or title is created for each group that captures the essence of the insights within it. This label becomes the theme.

4.  **Map the Themes & Discuss Findings:**
    * Arrange the labeled groups on a larger surface (wall, whiteboard, digital canvas like FigJam) to show relationships between themes, if any.
    * Discuss the overall patterns, key themes, significant pain points, and potential opportunities that have emerged from the mapping process.
    * This step helps in synthesizing the findings and communicating them to the team or stakeholders.

## Visual Example (Conceptual Flow)

1.  **Initial State:** Many individual sticky notes scattered (e.g., "Desktop in office," "Request for info in my inbox," "Wait for confirm").
2.  **Grouping:** Notes are moved and clustered based on similarity (e.g., all notes related to "Triggers" are placed together, notes about "Actions - Converting" form another cluster).
3.  **Labeling:** Each cluster is given a theme label (e.g., "Triggers," "Actions - Converting," "Barriers/Pain Points," "Entry Points").

## Best Practices for Affinity Mapping

* **Silence (for initial grouping):**
    * When first grouping notes, it can be effective for the team to work in silence. This allows individuals to form their own interpretations without being overly influenced by dominant voices.
    * After an initial silent sort, the team can then discuss and refine the groupings collaboratively.
* **Team Collaboration:**
    * Affinity mapping is most powerful as a team activity. Diverse perspectives enrich the interpretation of data.
    * Any grouping that the entire team cannot agree on or understand should be discussed and reorganized until consensus is reached or the distinct nature of the items is acknowledged.
* **Timebox the Activity:**
    * Set a time limit for different stages of the exercise (e.g., individual sorting, group discussion, labeling).
    * Timeboxing helps maintain focus, ensures the activity doesn't drag on indefinitely, and encourages efficient decision-making. It's important to cover the most critical aspects within the allocated time.
    * [[W2 - Starting Your UX Research (Planning & Preparation)#Tool FigmaFigJam|FigJam]] and other digital tools often have built-in timers.

## Grouping Guidelines (Rules of Thumb)

When forming groups or themes:

* **< 3 Data Points per Group - Too Small:** Consider if these insights can be folded into other, larger related groupings. A theme supported by only one or two unique users/data points might be an outlier or less significant unless the insight itself is exceptionally critical.
* **> 10 Data Points per Group - Too Big:** The theme might be too broad. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more specific sub-themes or sub-groupings.
* **1 Data Point per Group - Too Few (Outlier):** Generally, groupings should represent patterns observed across multiple users or data points. A single, isolated data point might be an outlier or a very niche observation. It should typically have at least 2 users/data points contributing to a theme to be considered a pattern.

## When to Stop Analyzing/Grouping

It can be challenging to know when the analysis is "done." Consider stopping or moving to the next stage when:

* **Increasingly Granular Insights:** You find yourself digging into very minute details that don't significantly alter the main themes or design direction. Ask: "How much does this really help the design team?"
* **No New Insights Emerge:** You're reviewing data, but the patterns and themes remain largely the same, and further sorting doesn't reveal new, meaningful understanding. This is often referred to as reaching "saturation."
* **Feeling Anxious about Elaborating (or Impatience to Flesh Out Details):**
    * Sometimes, if you're stuck or nervous about what detailed design work might reveal, it's a sign to start working through those details, but be vigilant about going down a rabbit hole.
    * Conversely, if you're very excited about an idea based on the themes, it might be time to start fleshing it out, as long as you can make decisions confidently based on the data. If you find yourself relying on assumptions, you might need more information.
* **The primary goal is to extract the [[W3 - Analysis and Synthesis in UX#Generating Insights|Interesting, Relevant, and Actionable]] insights that will inform the next steps in the design process.**
