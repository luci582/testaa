Triangulation is a research strategy used to enhance the validity and reliability of findings by incorporating multiple perspectives, data sources, methods, or investigators. In UX research, it serves as a form of cross-checking to build more robust and credible conclusions from the analysis of user data.

## What is Triangulation?

* **Definition:** The use of multiple approaches to study the same phenomenon to increase confidence in the findings. If different methods or sources point to similar conclusions, the credibility of those conclusions is strengthened.
* **Analogy:** Similar to how cell towers can pinpoint the location of a phone by receiving signals from three or more sources, triangulation in research uses multiple data points to "locate" a more accurate understanding.
* **Purpose in Qualitative Research:** Often viewed as a strategy to test validity through the convergence of information from different sources. It helps to compensate for the weaknesses inherent in any single method or data source.

## Why is Triangulation Important in UX?

* **Increases Credibility:** Corroborating findings through multiple lenses enhances the trustworthiness of the research outcomes.
* **Compensates for Weaknesses:** The limitations of one data source or method can be offset by the strengths of another.
* **Richer Understanding:** Provides a more holistic and nuanced view of the user experience by integrating diverse perspectives.
* **Validates Results:** Helps to confirm that findings are not merely an artifact of a specific method, researcher bias, or particular set of participants.

## Four Types of Triangulation (Denzin, 1978; Patton, 1999)

### 1. Data Triangulation (or Data Source Triangulation)
* **Definition:** Involves using various data sources within a single study. This means collecting data at different times, in different places (space), and from different people (persons).
* **Example:** To understand perceptions of a political event, a researcher might collect data from:
    * Different demographic groups.
    * People in various geographical locations.
    * At different points in time (e.g., before, during, and after the event).
* **In UX:** Gathering feedback on a product from new users, experienced users, and users with accessibility needs, or collecting data in different usage contexts.

### 2. Methodological Triangulation
* **Definition:** Involves using multiple research methods to study a single problem or phenomenon.
* **Sub-types:**
    * **Within-method:** Using multiple techniques within the same method (e.g., using different scales or question types within a single survey).
    * **Between-method (or Across-method):** Using different methods altogether (e.g., combining qualitative and quantitative methods â€“ also known as mixed-methods research).
* **Example:**
    * A study on website usability might use [[W2 - Quantitative Research Methods#5 Hotspots Eye Tracking|eye-tracking data]] (quantitative), [[W2 - User Interviews|user interviews]] (qualitative), and [[W2 - Quantitative Research Methods#2 Surveys|surveys]] (quantitative/qualitative).
    * If insights from user testing, survey results, web analytics, and benchmarking all point to similar usability issues or user preferences, this strengthens the findings.
* **Relevance:** This is a common and powerful approach in UX research.

### 3. Investigator Triangulation (or Researcher Triangulation)
* **Definition:** Involves using multiple researchers or evaluators in the data collection, analysis, or interpretation phases of a study.
* **Purpose:** Reduces the potential for individual researcher bias to influence the findings.
* **Example:**
    * Having multiple researchers conduct [[W2 - User Interviews|user interviews]] or observe usability tests.
    * Having different team members independently code qualitative data (like interview transcripts) and then compare their codes and themes to reach a consensus (inter-rater reliability).
    * The course tutors and lecturer all reviewing student work could be seen as a form of investigator triangulation in an assessment context.
* **Benefit:** Increases objectivity and can lead to richer interpretations as different investigators might notice different aspects of the data.

### 4. Theory Triangulation (or Theoretical Triangulation)
* **Definition:** Involves using multiple theoretical perspectives or lenses to interpret and explain a single set of data or phenomenon.
* **Purpose:** Provides a more comprehensive understanding by examining the issue from different conceptual angles.
* **Example:** To explain why users abandon an e-commerce checkout process, a researcher might draw upon:
    * **Cognitive Load Theory:** Suggests users might find the system too complex or overwhelming.
    * **Trust Theory / Security Risk Theory:** Suggests users might not trust the system's security or perceive a high risk of their information being compromised.
    Each theory offers a different explanation for the same observed behavior.
* **Application:** More common in academic research but can also help UX practitioners understand user behavior from broader psychological or sociological perspectives.

By strategically employing these triangulation techniques, UX researchers can produce more robust, reliable, and defensible insights, leading to more effective and user-centered design solutions.
