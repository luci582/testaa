Customer Journey Mapping is a powerful UX analysis and synthesis technique used to visualize the end-to-end experience a user (often represented by a [[W3 - Personas|Persona]]) has when interacting with a product, service, or system to achieve a specific goal. It helps designers and stakeholders understand the "front stage" of the service experience from the customer's point of view.

## What is a Customer Journey Map?

* **Definition:** A visual representation of a customer's process, needs, and perceptions throughout their interactions and relationship with a company or product to achieve a specific objective.
* **Perspective:** Always from the customer's (or persona's) point of view.
* **Scope:** Can map a broad end-to-end experience or a more specific interaction. It looks at the customer's ecosystem rather than a single touchpoint in isolation.
* **Elements Typically Visualized:**
    * **Phases/Stages:** The key stages the customer goes through in their journey.
    * **Actions:** What the customer is doing at each stage.
    * **Thoughts/Thinking:** What the customer is thinking at each stage.
    * **Feelings/Emotions:** The customer's emotional state (e.g., happy, frustrated, confused, anxious) at each stage, often shown as an "emotional curve."
    * **Touchpoints:** The points of interaction between the customer and the company/product/service.
    * **Pain Points:** Frustrations, obstacles, or negative experiences encountered.
    * **Opportunities:** Areas where the experience can be improved or new value can be created.

## Why are Customer Journey Maps Important?

* **Synthesize Insights & Visualize Findings:** They provide a compelling way to consolidate research data (from interviews, surveys, observations) into a sequential narrative.
* **Identify Critical Issues & Obstacles:** Clearly highlight where users struggle, experience frustration (pain points), or where gaps exist in the service experience.
* **Communicate New Opportunities:** By identifying pain points, journey maps help teams pinpoint areas for improvement and innovation. They help convert pain points into design opportunities.
* **Build Shared Vision & Empathy:** Help teams and stakeholders develop a common understanding of the customer experience and foster empathy for the user. It visualizes how [[W3 - Personas|personas]] feel and act.
* **Inform Design Decisions:** Provide a framework for prioritizing design efforts and ensuring solutions address real user needs and frustrations.
* **Holistic View:** Show the interconnectedness of different touchpoints and stages in the customer's experience.
* **Highlight Points of Delight:** Also identify moments where the user has a positive experience, which can be reinforced or learned from.

## Key Components of a Customer Journey Map

While templates vary, common components include:

1.  **Persona:** The journey map is usually tied to a specific persona, representing a key user segment.
2.  **Scenario/Goal:** The specific goal the persona is trying to achieve through this journey.
3.  **Phases/Stages:** The distinct steps or stages the persona goes through to achieve their goal. These should be contextualized to the specific problem space.
    * *Example (Online Shopping):* Awareness → Consideration/Research → Purchase → Delivery → Post-Receive Experience.
    * *Example (Event Attendance):* Awareness → Decide/Plan → Participate → After.
4.  **Actions:** The specific activities and behaviors the persona engages in at each stage.
5.  **Thoughts:** What the persona is thinking, their questions, and internal monologue at each stage.
6.  **Feelings/Emotions:** The emotional state of the persona throughout the journey, often visualized as an emotional curve (highs and lows). Emojis are commonly used for quick visual representation.
7.  **Touchpoints:** The specific points of interaction between the user and the organization/product/service (e.g., website, app, customer service call, physical store).
8.  **Pain Points:** Specific problems, frustrations, obstacles, or moments of friction experienced by the persona at each stage.
9.  **Opportunities:** Ideas for improvement, innovation, or new features that could address the pain points or enhance the positive aspects of the journey. This is where insights are translated into potential actions.
10. **(Optional) Quotes:** Direct quotes from user research that exemplify the thoughts, feelings, or pain points at a particular stage.
11. **(Optional) Ownership/Responsibility:** Who within the organization is responsible for each touchpoint or stage (more common in service blueprints, which are related but distinct).

## Creating a Customer Journey Map (General Steps)

1.  **Define Scope:** Choose the persona and the specific journey (scenario/goal) you want to map.
2.  **Outline Stages:** Identify the high-level stages the persona goes through. This often comes from research or workshop activities.
3.  **Populate with Research Data:** For each stage, fill in the details based on your research:
    * What actions are they taking?
    * What are they thinking?
    * How are they feeling?
    * What touchpoints are they interacting with?
    * What are their pain points?
4.  **Identify Opportunities:** Brainstorm potential solutions or improvements for each identified pain point or to enhance positive moments.
5.  **Visualize and Refine:** Create a clear visual representation of the map. Iterate and refine it with team input.

## Important Considerations

* **Current State vs. Future State:**
    * **Current State Journey Maps:** Document the user's experience as it *is now*. This is crucial for identifying existing problems and opportunities. (This is the focus for the INFS3700 assignment).
    * **Future State Journey Maps:** Envision the ideal user experience *after* design improvements have been implemented.
* **Based on Research:** Journey maps should be grounded in actual user research, not just assumptions.
* **Collaborative Tool:** Best created and used collaboratively with a cross-functional team.
* **Living Document:** Like personas, journey maps can be revisited and updated as more is learned or as the product/service evolves.

## Examples and Templates
* The lecture showcased various templates, including one from Miro and a recommended one from FigJam.
* **Key elements in good examples:**
    * Contextualized stages (not generic).
    * Use of sticky notes for actions, thoughts, pain points.
    * Clear visual representation of emotions (e.g., emotional curve, emojis).
    * Specific pain points identified.
    * Actionable opportunities derived from pain points.
* **What to avoid:** Long blocks of text instead of concise sticky notes; lack of clear emotional representation; poorly defined stages.

Customer journey mapping is a vital tool for synthesizing research, fostering empathy, and identifying key areas for design intervention to improve the overall user experience.
