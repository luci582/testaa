After conducting [[Week 02 - UX Research|UX research]] and gathering raw data (e.g., interview transcripts, workshop outputs, observation notes), the next critical phase is to make sense of this information. This involves both analysis (breaking down data) and synthesis (bringing ideas together) to derive actionable insights that will inform design decisions. This stage aligns with the "Define" phase of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]], where the focus is on clarifying the problem and identifying key opportunities.

## From Data to Insights

* **Starting Point:** Raw data collected from research activities. This data can be in various forms (text, audio, video, sticky notes with quotes/observations).
* **Goal of Analysis:** To distill raw data into information that can be used for design. This involves looking for themes, trends, patterns, and significant observations within the data.
    * **Common Themes/Trends to Look For:**
        * **Attributes:** Characteristics of users or situations.
        * **Pain Points:** Frustrations, difficulties, or problems users experience.
        * **Sentiment:** How users feel (e.g., happy, frustrated, confused).
        * **Problems:** Specific issues identified.
        * **Behaviors:** How users act or what they do.
        * **Requests and Needs:** What users explicitly or implicitly require.
        * **Goals:** What users are ultimately trying to achieve.
* **Generating Insights:**
    * **Definition:** Data insights are knowledge gained from analyzing sets of information. They transform information into useful, meaningful understanding.
    * **Purpose:** Help businesses make informed decisions, reduce risks, and inform strategic direction.
    * **Process Visualized:** Data → (Analytics/Analysis) → Insights
    * **IRA Criteria for Strong Insights:** Insights should ideally be:
        * **Interesting:** Is the finding unexpected, counter-intuitive, or does it challenge existing assumptions? Does it change your perspective?
        * **Relevant:** Is the insight useful in answering the core research questions or explaining something significant about the user/problem?
        * **Actionable:** Can this insight be used to inform design decisions or lead to concrete actions? What will change because of this insight?

## Sensemaking Steps in UX Analysis

Sensemaking is the continuous effort to understand connections (among people, places, events) to anticipate trajectories and act effectively. In UX, it involves:

### 1. Analysis
* **Definition:** The process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.
* **In UX:** Breaking down qualitative data (e.g., interview transcripts, observation notes) into smaller, manageable pieces. This involves identifying key quotes, observations, and data points.
* **Techniques Covered This Week:** [[W3 - Affinity Mapping|Affinity Mapping]], [[W3 - Triangulation in Research|Triangulation]].

### 2. Synthesis
* **Definition:** The process of bringing diverse research ideas and data points together to form a new, unified understanding or concept. It's about seeing the bigger picture and connecting the dots.
* **Contrast with Analysis:** If analysis is about breaking things down, synthesis is about building them up into a coherent whole.
* **In UX:** Helps to understand the problems users are facing from a holistic perspective, which in turn informs why a specific product or feature is being built.
* **Techniques Covered This Week:** Creating [[W3 - Personas|Personas]] and [[W3 - Customer Journey Mapping|Customer Journey Maps]].

### 3. Frame & Focus
* **Definition:** The process of structuring insights or problem details in a digestible and collaborative way. How a problem is framed influences how it is understood and approached.
* **Importance:** Looking at a problem or insight from different perspectives (lenses) can reveal different opportunities and lead to different solutions.
* **Example:** An IT system failure can be framed as:
    * An *IT issue* (focus on fixing software bugs).
    * A *management problem* (focus on governance and oversight).
    * An *IT security problem* (focus on cybersecurity measures).
    Each framing leads to a different set of actions and solutions.
* **Techniques Covered This Week:** [[W3 - Problem Framing|Problem Framing]] and [[W3 - Prioritization Techniques|Prioritization]].

## The Overall Flow
The analysis and synthesis approach involves moving through these sensemaking steps, using specific techniques at each stage to transform raw research data into actionable design directives. The ultimate aim is to clearly define the problem to be solved and identify the most promising opportunities for design.
