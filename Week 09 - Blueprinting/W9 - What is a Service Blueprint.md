This week, we delve into Service Blueprinting, a key operational tool in Service Design. Building on the [[Week 08 - Service Design Introduction|introduction to Service Design]], blueprints help visualize the intricate components of a service and how they interrelate to deliver the customer experience. This tool is crucial for analyzing existing services and designing new or improved ones, focusing on both customer-facing (frontstage) and internal (backstage) operations. It helps to orchestrate the people, props, and processes involved in a service.

The lecture will cover what a service blueprint is, its core elements and structure (including the line of visibility and line of interaction), the step-by-step process of creating one, the importance of collaboration and different fidelity levels, and how blueprints are used for prototyping, supporting a service vision, and identifying reusable service patterns. We'll also revisit general service design principles.

## Key Topics for Week 9

This week's content is structured around the following key areas:

* [[W9 - What is a Service Blueprint]]: Defining service blueprints, their purpose in visualizing service components (people, props, processes) tied to touchpoints in the customer journey, the distinction between frontstage and backstage actions, their evolution as a design tool, and the value they bring in visualizing complexity, aligning perspectives, and enabling prototyping.
* [[W9 - Creating a Service Blueprint]]: Understanding the core elements (customer actions, touchpoints, frontstage staff actions, backstage staff actions, support processes) and structure of a blueprint (time, experience stages, swim lanes, line of visibility, line of interaction, service moments). This includes the step-by-step process of building a blueprint, the importance of collaboration, considering different fidelity levels (sticky notes, spreadsheets, printed posters), and managing the level of "zoom" or detail.
* [[W9 - Using a Service Blueprint]]: Exploring how blueprints are utilized for prototyping service experiences (e.g., through service storming), supporting and communicating a service vision (often in conjunction with storyboards and roadmaps), and identifying reusable service patterns for efficiency and consistency.
* [[W9 - Service Blueprint Templates]]: Reviewing examples and templates for creating service blueprints, with a specific example available in FigJam.
* [[W9 - Service Design Principles & Capabilities]]: A recap of overarching principles that guide effective service design, such as being human-centered, collaborative, iterative, sequenced, real, and holistic.
