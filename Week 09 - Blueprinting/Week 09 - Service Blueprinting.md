This week, we delve into Service Blueprinting, a key operational tool in Service Design. Building on the [[Week 08 - Service Design Introduction|introduction to Service Design]], blueprints help visualize the intricate components of a service and how they interrelate to deliver the customer experience. This tool is crucial for analyzing existing services and designing new or improved ones, focusing on both customer-facing (frontstage) and internal (backstage) operations.

The lecture will cover what a service blueprint is, its core elements and structure, the process of creating one, and its various uses, such as for prototyping and ensuring service consistency. We'll also touch upon general service design principles.

## Key Topics for Week 9

This week's content is structured around the following key areas:

* [[W9 - What is a Service Blueprint]]: Defining service blueprints, their purpose in visualizing service components, the distinction between frontstage and backstage actions, and their evolution as a design tool.
* [[W9 - Creating a Service Blueprint]]: Understanding the core elements of a blueprint (e.g., customer actions, touchpoints, staff actions, support processes), its structure (time, experience stages, swim lanes, line of visibility, line of interaction, service moments), the step-by-step process of building one, and the importance of collaboration and fidelity levels.
* [[W9 - Using a Service Blueprint]]: Exploring how blueprints are used for prototyping service experiences (e.g., service storming), supporting a service vision (by complementing storyboards and roadmaps), and identifying reusable service patterns.
* [[W9 - Service Blueprint Templates]]: Reviewing examples and templates for creating service blueprints, particularly using FigJam.
* [[W9 - Service Design Principles & Capabilities]]: Revisiting overarching principles that guide effective service design.

## Assignment Focus
* **Individual Assignment:** Due this week (Thursday 5 pm). Service blueprinting itself isn't a direct deliverable for the individual assignment, but the holistic understanding of service components is valuable context.
* **Group Project Presentation (Week 10):** Groups should start preparing their 10-minute workshop playback presentation for the Week 10 tutorial. All members are expected to present. Tutors need to be emailed the PPT before the tutorial. Peer review of other groups' presentations will also occur.
