Embarking on UX research requires careful planning and preparation to ensure that the efforts are focused, efficient, and yield valuable insights. This note outlines the initial steps in the UX research process, focusing on planning learning goals, preparing activities and materials, and participant recruitment, which are particularly relevant for the group assignment workshop.

## The UX Research Process Overview

A typical UX research process can be broken down into several key stages:

1.  **Plan:** Identify learning goals and objectives.
2.  **Prepare:** Prepare activities, materials, and recruit participants.
3.  **Field (Conduct):** Execute the research (e.g., conduct interviews, run workshops).
4.  **Analyze:** Understand the collected data, synthesize findings. (Covered in [[Week 03 - UX Analysis]])
5.  **Report:** Communicate the findings and recommendations.

This week's focus is primarily on the **Plan** and **Prepare** stages, with some discussion on **Fielding** [[W2 - User Interviews|interviews]] and [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research|workshops]].

## 1. Plan: Defining Learning Objectives and Scope

Effective planning is crucial to reduce the risk of things going wrong during fieldwork and to ensure the research addresses the right questions.

* **Articulate Learning Objectives:**
    * What questions do you need to answer?
    * Who are the users/people impacted by the system or problem?
    * Where does this problem occur (context)?
    * How might you learn more (what research activities are appropriate)?
* **Stakeholder Interviews:**
    * **Purpose:** Interviewing internal stakeholders (e.g., product managers, business analysts, SMEs) is a useful tool in research planning.
    * **Benefits:**
        * **Shared Understanding:** Builds consensus around the problem space.
        * **Context:** Understands the business problem from the perspective of those experiencing or dealing with it.
        * **Customer Knowledge:** Gains second-hand knowledge of customer behaviors and attitudes.
        * **Success Metrics:** Understands what "success looks like" to the business if the problem is solved.
* **Create a Research Plan:** A document that outlines the research.
    * **Turn stakeholder feedback into themes.**
    * **Re-frame your problem statement as a project objective.**
    * **Think about logistics and viability:** Consider time, costs, and capacity.
    * **Key Questions to Address in a Research Plan:**
        * **Problem Statement/Project Objective:** What is the overall goal of the research?
        * **Proposed Research Approach:** What methods will be used (e.g., workshop, interviews)? *WHY this approach?*
        * **Key Research Questions:** What specific questions need to be answered? *WHY these questions?*
        * **Research Sample/Participants:** Who will be included in the research? *What is the rationale for this sample? Why are certain groups included/excluded?*
    * **Importance:** If you can't answer these "WHY" questions, you may need to think more deeply. The research plan is also a communication tool for wider stakeholders.

## 2. Prepare: Readying Materials and Recruiting Participants

Preparation involves getting all materials and people ready for the research activities. Each step helps remove an element of risk for the day of fielding.

### A. Recruitment – Recruiting Participants
* **Define "Who":**
    * Clearly define the type of customers/users needed to gain insights.
    * Define the behaviors you need to discuss and observe.
    * Who is your target participant? Who is *not* your target?
* **Define "What":**
    * What type of research will be conducted (e.g., 1-hour online workshop)?
    * What do you need to do to make this work (e.g., technology, incentives)?
* **Define "How":**
    * How will you find these people (e.g., recruitment platforms like Askable, existing customer databases, personal networks for low-stakes studies)?
    * What is the impact of your sampling methodology on your outcomes?
* **Define "Where":**
    * Where will the research be conducted (e.g., online via video conference, in-person at a specific location)?
    * What is appropriate, practical, and possible?
* **Define "When":**
    * When will you speak to participants?
    * How long will you need with them?
* **Participant Recruitment Brief (for Group Assignment):**
    * A document outlining the criteria for selecting participants for the workshop.
    * Consider the chosen problem space (e.g., "trailblazing in Sydney" might require runners/bikers; "conference event management" might require past conference attendees/organizers).
    * Specify any additional criteria (e.g., "internet savvy" for online workshops).

### B. Activity – Preparing Discussion Guides
A discussion guide is a structured list of questions and topics to be covered during an interview or workshop. It acts as a roadmap for the facilitator.

* **Visualizing the Discussion:** Plan the guide around expected energy levels and social dynamics of a session (e.g., Tuckman's stages: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing).
* **Natural Flow:**
    * Start with broad topic areas and gradually move to more specific areas of interest.
    * Ensure a logical progression of questions.
* **Avoid Repetition:** It can kill conversation flow.
* **Tailor to Audience:** You might need slightly different versions for different participant groups.
* **Working Document:** Treat the guide as flexible; be prepared to deviate if interesting and relevant topics emerge.
* **Key Sections for a [[W2 - User Interviews|User Interview]] or [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research|Workshop]] Discussion Guide (often similar structure):**
    1.  **Introductions/Forming:** Welcome, purpose, privacy, consent, expectations.
    2.  **Warm-up/Start Broad:** Build rapport, gather general context.
    3.  **Deep Dive into Key Topics:** Focus on specific research questions and activities.
    4.  **Wind Down:** Summarize (if appropriate), ask for final thoughts/questions.
    5.  **Thank & Close:** Express gratitude, explain next steps.
* **Tips for Writing Guides:**
    * **Make it clear:** Use simple language.
    * **Ensure inclusivity:** Frame questions in a way that is respectful and accessible to all participants.
    * **Keep it relaxed:** The guide is a tool, not a rigid script.

### C. Operations – Organizing Materials / Logistics
* Ensure all necessary tools (e.g., video conferencing, whiteboarding software), templates, and physical materials are ready.
* Test technology beforehand.
* Confirm schedules with participants and team members.

### D. Ethics – Organizing Consent Forms and Sign Off
* Prepare consent forms outlining the research purpose, data usage, confidentiality, and participant rights.
* Ensure participants understand and sign/agree to the consent terms before the session begins (verbal consent should also be obtained at the start of recordings).
* Covered in more detail in [[W2 - What is UX Research#Ethical Considerations in UX Research|Ethical Considerations]].

## 3. Field: Conducting the Research
This refers to the "doing" of the research – facilitating the interview or workshop.

* **Facilitation Techniques:** (Covered in more detail in [[W2 - User Interviews]] and [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research]])
    * Create a comfortable and relaxed space (physically or virtually).
    * Adopt a neutral, empathetic mindset.
    * Set ground rules and expectations clearly.
    * Manage time and energy levels.
    * Encourage participation from everyone.
    * Actively listen and probe appropriately.
* **Reflection:** After each session, reflect on what worked well and what could be improved for future sessions. This helps refine research techniques.

## Tool: Figma/FigJam
* **Figma:** A collaborative interface design tool.
* **FigJam:** An online whiteboarding tool by Figma, used for brainstorming, diagramming, and collaborative activities like those in the [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research#The 4Cs Framework from The Workshopper Playbook by Jonathan Courtney|4Cs framework]].
* **Account Setup for Course:**
    * Sign up for a Figma account using your student email.
    * A free account is initially fine, but **upgrade to an education account** (instructions on Moodle).
    * The education account is needed to allow guest access for workshop participants without them needing to create Figma accounts (via "open access" sharing).
    * The upgrade process might take some time for validation.

This planning and preparation phase is crucial for ensuring that the subsequent research activities are productive and yield meaningful insights that can genuinely inform the design process.
