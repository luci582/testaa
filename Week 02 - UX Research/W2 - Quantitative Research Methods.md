Quantitative research in UX focuses on numerical data and statistical analysis to measure user behavior, preferences, and attitudes. These methods help build confidence in findings, measure the success of design solutions, identify patterns, and provide evidence to support business decisions. The presence of numeric data is a clear indicator of a quantitative method.

## Purpose of Quantitative Methods in UX

UX Quantitative research activities allow us to:

* **Build Confidence:** Validate hypotheses and confirm assumptions with numerical evidence.
* **Measure Success:** Evaluate the performance of a design or solution against specific metrics (e.g., task completion rates, conversion rates).
* **Evaluate Problems/Groups:** Assess the scale of a problem or the characteristics of a user group.
* **Analyze Data & Synthesize Insights:** Use statistical methods to understand data.
* **Identify Patterns:** Discover trends and correlations in user behavior or feedback.
* **Support Business Decisions:** Provide data-driven rationale for design choices and investments.
* **Justify and Validate:** Confirm findings from qualitative research or initial assumptions.
* **"Close Down" Inquiry:** Move towards specific conclusions based on measurable results.
* **Double Diamond Alignment:** Primarily used in the **Define** and **Deliver** phases of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]].

## Common Quantitative Research Methods

### 1. Card Sorting
* **Definition:** A research technique used to discover how people understand and categorize information. Participants are given "cards" (representing topics or items) and asked to group them in a way that makes sense to them.
* **Purpose:** Helps in designing or evaluating the information architecture (IA) of a site or app, defining structure, and labeling content.
* **Types:**
    * **Open Card Sort:** Participants create their own group names/labels for the categories they form. Provides rich qualitative insights into users' mental models.
    * **Closed Card Sort:** Participants sort items into predefined categories. Useful for evaluating an existing structure or when categories are already established.
    * **Hybrid Card Sort:** Combines elements of both, allowing participants to use predefined categories but also create new ones if needed.
* **Benefits:**
    * Simple, quick, and quantifiable (especially closed sorts).
    * Cost-effective.
    * Provides quantitative evidence for IA decisions (e.g., frequency of items grouped together).
    * Helps understand users' [[W1 - User Goals, Behaviour, and Context#3 Mental Models|mental models]].
* **Tools:** Can be done physically with paper cards or digitally using online card sorting tools.
* **Further Discussion:** Will be revisited in [[Week 04 - Design Principles & Ideation]] (to be populated).

### 2. Surveys (Online Surveys)
* **Definition:** A structured questionnaire completed by users, typically online, to gather information about their attitudes, preferences, behaviors, or demographic characteristics.
* **Purpose:** To collect data from a broad audience, measure customer behavior, rate satisfaction, capture complaints, evaluate initial ideas, or size a potential market.
* **Key Learnings from Surveys:**
    * Who your users are (demographics).
    * What your users want to accomplish.
    * What information your users are looking for.
* **Survey Tools:** Qualtrics, Menti, Microsoft Forms, Google Forms.
* **Survey Planning:**
    * **Objective Clarity:** Define key learning objectives. What do you want to find out?
    * **Target Audience:** Who should be surveyed? How will they be reached? What motivates them to respond?
    * **Question Design:** Ensure the right number of questions (avoiding excessive length â€“ aim for <15-20 mins completion time), ease of understanding (simple, specific language, avoid jargon), and a clear, logical flow.
    * **Data Collection & Analysis Plan:** How will data be collected, stored (with privacy in mind), and analyzed?
* **Survey Scripting (Question Design):**
    * Ask more general questions first (traditional advice, though sometimes important questions are placed earlier if attention drop-off is a concern).
    * 'Chunk' and section questions logically to improve flow and reduce cognitive load.
    * Write simple, succinct questions using language familiar to the audience.
    * Ask only one question at a time; avoid double-barreled questions.
    * Be intentional with every question to serve the objective and avoid bias.
* **Survey Question Types:**
    * **Open-ended:** Start with "Why?", "How?", "What?". Encourage detailed, qualitative responses. (e.g., "In a few words, why did you choose that answer?")
    * **Closed-ended:** Provide a set of predefined responses. Easier to complete and analyze quantitatively. (e.g., Multiple choice: "What best describes your home? ( ) Single-family home ( ) Apartment...")
    * **Likert Scale:** Respondents specify their level of agreement or disagreement with a series of statements on a scale (e.g., 5-point or 7-point scale from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree").
* **Survey Tips:**
    * Keep it simple: Short questions, plain language.
    * Time to complete: Provide an estimate and a progress indicator.
    * Mix of questions: Use a variety to meet qualitative and quantitative needs.
    * Data collection ethics: Ensure privacy and secure storage.
    * **Attention Checks:** Include questions designed to verify if participants are paying attention (e.g., "Please select 'Strongly Disagree' for this item"). This helps filter out low-quality responses.

### 3. A/B Testing
* **Definition:** A method of comparing two versions of a webpage, app screen, or other artifact (Version A and Version B) to see which one performs better in achieving a specific goal. Users are randomly shown one version, and their interactions are tracked.
* **Purpose:** To collect insights on user preferences and optimize designs for specific outcomes (e.g., higher conversion rates, more clicks).
* **Example:** Testing two different headlines for an article to see which gets more clicks, or two different button colors on a call-to-action to see which leads to more sign-ups.

### 4. Web Analytics
* **Definition:** The collection, reporting, and analysis of website or app data.
* **Purpose:** To identify trends in user behavior, understand how users interact with a digital product, and measure key performance indicators (KPIs).
* **Key Metrics:**
    * **Browse Time:** How long users spend on pages/site.
    * **Click-Through Rates (CTR):** Percentage of users who click on a specific link or ad.
    * **Bounce Rates:** Percentage of visitors who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page. A high bounce rate can indicate problems with page content, relevance, or usability.
    * Conversion Rates: Percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase, sign-up).
* **Tools:** Google Analytics is a widely used tool.

### 5. Hotspots / Eye Tracking
* **Definition:**
    * **Hotspots (Heatmaps):** Visual representations of where users click, tap, or move their mouse on a screen. "Hotter" areas indicate more interaction.
    * **Eye Tracking:** Technology that measures eye positions and movements to understand where users are looking on a screen.
* **Purpose:** To understand user attention and engagement with different parts of an interface, helping to optimize layout and placement of important elements.
* **Application:** Assists with user interface design by showing which elements draw the most attention or are most frequently interacted with.
