This week delves into the critical role of UX Research in the design process. Building on the foundational concepts from Week 1, we explore why and how research is conducted to understand users, their needs, pain points, and behaviors. This understanding is essential for creating empathetic and effective designs.

The lecture covers the distinction between primary and secondary research, qualitative and quantitative methods, and introduces specific techniques such as user interviews, workshops, card sorting, and surveys. Ethical considerations in research are also highlighted. A significant portion of this week is dedicated to preparing for the group assignment, focusing on workshop planning using the 4Cs framework and participant recruitment.
