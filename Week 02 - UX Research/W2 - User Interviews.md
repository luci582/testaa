User interviews are a fundamental qualitative research method in UX, involving direct, one-on-one conversations with users to gather in-depth insights into their thoughts, behaviors, motivations, and opinions. They are crucial for developing empathy and understanding the user's perspective, especially during the "Discover" and "Define" phases of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]].

## Purpose and Value of User Interviews

* **Deep Insights:** Uncover rich, nuanced information that surveys or analytics might miss. They help understand the "why" behind user actions.
* **Empathy Building:** Allow researchers to connect with users on a personal level, fostering a deeper understanding of their experiences and frustrations.
* **Problem Discovery:** Identify pain points, unmet needs, and opportunities for improvement in existing products or services, or to inform new concepts.
* **Contextual Understanding:** While not the same as full [[W2 - Qualitative Research Methods#2 Contextual Inquiry|Contextual Inquiry]], interviews can still explore the context surrounding user behavior.
* **Flexibility:** The interviewer can probe deeper into interesting responses, ask follow-up questions, and adapt the conversation based on the interviewee's answers.

## Characteristics of User Interviews

* **Personal:** A more direct and personal form of research compared to questionnaires. The researcher works directly with the interviewee.
* **Easier for the Customer (often):** Can be less demanding than filling out long surveys, especially if opinions and impressions are sought. People often prefer talking to writing.
* **Opportunity for Follow-up:** Unlike static surveys, interviewers can ask clarifying questions and delve deeper into topics as they arise.

## Challenges of User Interviews

* **Time-Consuming:** Can be resource-intensive to plan, conduct, transcribe, and analyze.
* **Interviewer Skill:** The quality of insights depends heavily on the interviewer's ability to build rapport, ask effective questions, listen actively, and avoid bias. Good training is essential.
* **Potential for Bias:** Interviewer bias (e.g., leading questions) or interviewee bias (e.g., social desirability) can influence responses.
* **Small Sample Sizes:** Due to the time investment, interviews are typically conducted with a smaller number of participants compared to surveys, meaning findings might not be generalizable to a larger population without further validation.

## Crafting Interview Questions

Effective questioning is key to successful user interviews.

### Questions to AVOID:

* **Leading Questions:** These suggest a desired answer or reflect the interviewer's bias.
    * *Example to avoid:* "Wouldn't you like it if...?" or "Are those banners distracting?" (This assumes the banners *are* distracting).
    * *Better alternative:* "Tell me about your experience with the banners on this page." or "What are your thoughts on this part of the screen?"
* **Hypothetical Questions:** Asking users to speculate about future behavior or imaginary scenarios is often unreliable. People are not good at predicting their future actions accurately.
    * *Example to avoid:* "If the buttons were green, what would you do?" or "If you had a savings account, what would you do with it?"
    * *Better alternative:* Focus on past experiences: "Tell me about a time you tried to save money. What did you do?"
* **Design Questions (Asking users to be designers):** Users are experts in their own experience, not necessarily in design solutions.
    * *Example to avoid:* "What would make this screen better?" or "What features should we add to the app?"
    * *Better alternative:* Focus on problems and needs: "What challenges did you face when trying to complete [task]?" or "What information were you looking for that you couldn't find?"

### Effective Question Types to USE:

* **"What" Questions (Descriptive/Observational):** Encourage users to describe their actions, thoughts, and observations.
    * *Examples:* "What are you trying to do here?" "What do you see on this screen?" "What did you expect to see?" "What are you thinking now?"
* **"Why" Questions (Explanatory/Probing):** Help uncover underlying motivations, reasons, and mental models. Use with care to avoid making users defensive.
    * *Examples:* "Why do you think that?" "Why did you ask that question?" "Why did you do that?"
* **"How" Questions (Process-oriented):**
    * *Examples:* "How did you go about doing that?" "Can you walk me through how you usually [perform a task]?"
* **Summing Up / Reflective Questions:** Good for closing topics or the interview.
    * *Examples:* "Was there anything you were surprised to see?" "Was there anything you expected to see, but didn't?" "If you could describe your experience with X in one word, what would it be?"
* **Silence (The "No Question" Question):** Don't be afraid of silence. Give the participant time to think and elaborate. Often, valuable insights emerge when users fill a pause.

## Developing Empathy in Interviews

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. It is crucial for user researchers.

* **Why Empathy is Important:**
    * **True Understanding:** Allows researchers to uncover root causes of problems and users' underlying beliefs and feelings.
    * **Better Communication:** Fosters trust and openness, leading to more honest and detailed responses.
    * **User-Centered Solutions:** Leads to the creation of products and services that genuinely meet user needs and resonate with them.
* **How Empathy Can Be Developed:**
    * **Adopt a Neutral Mindset:** Approach interviews with an open mind, free of preconceived notions or judgments. Be genuinely curious.
    * **Active Listening:** Pay close attention not just to what is said, but how it's said (tone, emotion). Don't just wait for your turn to speak; truly listen to understand.
    * **"Walk a Mile in Another Person's Shoes":** Try to see the world from the user's perspective. Consider their context, challenges, and motivations.
    * **Observe Non-Verbal Cues:** Pay attention to body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice, as these can convey a lot of information.
* **The Cycle of Learning, Understanding, and Developing Empathy:**
    * The process of creating something (an idea) benefits from a parallel cycle focused on people:
        * **Listen:** Actively listen to users.
        * **Simmer:** Reflect on what you've heard and observed.
        * **Walk in Shoes:** Try to experience or imagine their perspective.
        * **Developing Empathy:** This leads to a deeper understanding.
        * **Applying Empathy:** Use this understanding in brainstorming and problem-solving.
        * This cycle enhances brainstorming by bringing greater depth and user-centricity.
* **Benefits of Applied Empathy:**
    * **Better Interviewers:** Helps surface real-world problems and feelings more effectively.
    * **Better Teammates:** Improves identification of when others need support.
    * **Better Leaders:** Enables stepping back and understanding diverse views more easily.

## Interview Structure & Facilitation (Fielding an Interview)

A structured approach helps ensure a smooth and productive interview.

1.  **Set the Ground Rules (Forming):**
    * **Introductions:** Introduce yourself and the purpose of the interview.
    * **Reassurance:** Make the participant comfortable. Emphasize there are no right or wrong answers and that their honest feedback is valued.
    * **Privacy/Consent:** Confirm recording consent, explain confidentiality, and how data will be used.
    * **Expectations:** Briefly outline the session flow and duration.
2.  **Start Broad & Gather Context (Storming/Norming):**
    * **Build Rapport:** Begin with general, easy questions to help the participant relax and open up. Ask about them, their role, or general experiences related to the topic.
    * **Background:** Gather context about their situation relevant to the problem space.
    * **Transition:** Gradually move from broad topics toward more specific areas of interest. Avoid sensitive topics too early.
3.  **Deep Dive into Areas of Interest (Performing):**
    * **Focus:** This is where you ask your core questions related to your research objectives.
    * **Structure:** Subdivide this section into smaller topics to keep the conversation varied and focused. Use your discussion guide, but be flexible.
4.  **Exercises & Activities (Optional):**
    * **Purpose:** If applicable, introduce activities (e.g., card sorting, looking at a prototype) when energy is high.
    * **Planning:** Plan questions around the exercise just as you would for other parts of the interview. Allow time to explain the exercise clearly.
5.  **Wind Down:**
    * **Signal End:** Acknowledge that the interview is drawing to a close.
    * **Final Questions:** Ask if there's anything else they'd like to share or any questions they have for you.
    * **Recap (Optional):** Briefly summarize key takeaways to ensure understanding (be careful not to lead).
6.  **Thank & Close:**
    * **Gratitude:** Thank the participant sincerely for their time and insights.
    * **Next Steps:** Let them know what will happen next (if appropriate).
    * **Feedback:** Ask if they have any feedback on the interview process itself.
