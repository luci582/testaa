Workshops are collaborative sessions that bring together researchers, designers, business stakeholders, and sometimes even customers to understand current states, ideate future states, or co-create solutions. Facilitation is a key skill for design professionals and future leaders.

## What are Workshops in UX?

* **Definition:** Structured, facilitated sessions designed to achieve a specific outcome related to a design challenge or research question.
* **Participants:** Can include a diverse group: UX team members, developers, product managers, marketing staff, subject matter experts (SMEs), and users/customers.
* **Purpose:**
    * To gather information and understand the current state of a problem or system.
    * To generate ideas and explore potential solutions (ideate a future state).
    * To co-create designs or strategies.
    * To build shared understanding and alignment among stakeholders.
    * To make decisions collaboratively.

## The Importance of Workshop Facilitation

Effective workshop facilitation is crucial for success. It involves:

* **Preparation & Planning:** Detailed attention to defining objectives, selecting activities, preparing materials, and managing logistics.
* **Reading the Room:** Ability to sense the energy and engagement of participants and adapt accordingly.
* **Creating a Safe Space:** Fostering an environment where all participants feel comfortable sharing ideas and opinions without judgment.
* **Managing Energy Levels:** Keeping participants engaged and motivated, possibly by sharing facilitation load or incorporating breaks and varied activities.
* **Setting the Pace:** Using timers and clear instructions to keep activities on track.
* **Having Fun:** Making the experience enjoyable can lead to better participation and outcomes.

## Types of UX Workshops

There are several key types of workshops used across the design profession:

### 1. Kick-off & Scoping Workshops
* **Purpose:** Conducted at the beginning of a project to set the scene, define the challenge, establish project goals, align stakeholders, and create initial focus.
* **Timing:** Often performed in the first week of a project.
* **Key Activities/Outputs:**
    * Defining the project challenge and objectives.
    * Stakeholder mapping (e.g., using RACI - Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).
    * Defining what's in-scope and out-of-scope for the project.
    * Identifying what is known and what needs to be learned ("what we know & what we don't").
    * Risk and territory mapping (e.g., PESTLE - Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental analysis).
    * Establishing project team values, roles, cadence, and ways of working.
    * Team bonding.
* **Benefits:** Educates stakeholders on the design process, manages expectations, builds trust.

### 2. Co-design Workshops
* **Purpose:** To collaboratively create or refine design artifacts (like personas, journey maps) or strategies with a diverse group of stakeholders (internal team members, SMEs, clients). The aim is to finalize data and insights around the current state or shape outputs together.
* **Focus:** Generating a sense of ownership and buy-in from participants.
* **Things to Co-design:**
    * Personas
    * Customer Journey Maps
    * Business Model Canvas
    * Project requirements & scope
* **Typical Structure (Beginning, Middle, End):**
    * **Welcome and Warm-up:** Set the tone, housekeeping, principles.
    * **Icebreaker:** Introductions and an activity to get the group started.
    * **Project Context:** Purpose and background of the project.
    * **Introduction to Process:** Raise awareness of the design process, set expectations.
    * **Workshop Activities:** Use a mix of group work and individual reflection.
    * **Reflections and Discussion:** Recap learning, share thoughts and concerns.
    * **Feedback:** Gather quick feedback on the workshop experience.

### 3. Customer Workshops
* **Purpose:** To directly involve real customers in the design or ideation process to co-create solutions or gather deep insights into their needs and frustrations. This is a prime example of human-centered design in action.
* **Evolution:** An evolution of traditional [[W2 - Qualitative Research Methods#4 Focus Groups Online Communities|focus groups]], but more interactive and generative.
* **Example:** Helping design credit card reward programs by pairing customers with designers for workshop sessions to visualize initial ideas.
* **Techniques for Customer Workshops:**
    * Use warm-ups and icebreakers.
    * Mix individual work (to avoid groupthink/bias from outspoken members) with group discussion.
    * Capture ideas on sticky notes and display them.
    * Promote standing and movement.
    * Use workshop templates to structure activities.
    * Avoid business jargon; use language customers understand.
* **Important Note:** Customers are not designers. The facilitator's role is to help translate raw ideas from customers into actionable design insights.

### 4. Learning Workshops (Capability Building)
* **Purpose:** To up-skill team members, clients, or other stakeholders in specific design skills, tools, frameworks, or methodologies.
* **Benefits:**
    * Builds internal design capability within an organization.
    * Improves "ways of working" and collaboration.
    * Increases the visibility and perceived value of the design discipline.
* **Tips:**
    * Select the right participants and tailor content to their needs.
    * Use examples from outside the participants' immediate industry to remove bias and encourage "outside-in" thinking.
    * Run "empathy" exercises.

## The 4Cs Framework (from "The Workshopper Playbook" by Jonathan Courtney)

A framework outlining four key stages for structuring workshops, particularly relevant for the group assignment in this course. It provides specific tools and activities for each stage.

* **Purpose:** To better understand intended users *before* doing any design solutioning.
* **Stages (forming a mini-Double Diamond within the broader research phase):**
    1.  **Collect (Diverge - Understand Current State):**
        * **Goal:** Gather information and understand the current situation, user needs, and problems.
        * **Activities:** Expert Interviews, Lightning Demos, Sailboat, Product Map, Business Model Canvas, Setting the Scene, Retrospective, Parking Lot, User Observations, Empathy Map.
    2.  **Choose (Converge - Identify Common Problems):**
        * **Goal:** Synthesize information, identify common themes and problems, and prioritize areas of focus.
        * **Activities:** Dot Voting, Sticky Notes Tree (Affinity Diagramming), Map Target, Heat Map, Straw Poll, Decider Vote, Pick your Top 3, Focus Question, Categories, Ranking.
    3.  **Create (Diverge - Ideas to Solve Problems):**
        * **Goal:** Generate a wide range of potential ideas and solutions for the chosen problems.
        * **Activities:** Note Taking, Doodling, Crazy Eights, Three Step Concept, Quick Ideas, Business Strategy Concept, User Test Flow, Idea Storm, Elevator Pitches, SCAMPER.
    4.  **Commit (Converge - Prioritize Best Ideas):**
        * **Goal:** Evaluate and prioritize the generated ideas to decide on the most promising ones to move forward with.
        * **Activities:** 2-Year Goal, Can We Questions, Define the Purpose, Storyboarding, Breadboarding, Effort/Impact Scale, Roadmap, Divide and Conquer, Turn Ideas into Actions, Presentation of Outcomes.
* **Application in Double Diamond:** The 4Cs process, as used in the group assignment workshop, primarily fits within the first diamond (Research) of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]]. "Collect" and "Choose" align with "Discover" and "Define" respectively, focusing on the problem space. "Create" and "Commit" explore potential solution directions at a conceptual level based on user understanding, still within the broader research/understanding phase.
* **Resources:** "Workshopper Playbook" and "Workshop Encyclopedia" (available on Moodle under Assignments).

## Workshop Planning for Group Assignment
* Students will start their workshop plan in Week 2 tutorials.
* Utilize the 4Cs framework and select appropriate activities.
* Create a participant recruitment brief.
* Use [[W2 - Starting Your UX Research (Planning & Preparation)#Tool FigmaFigJam|FigJam]] for collaborative whiteboarding.
* The workshop plan is due in Week 3, and the final workshop submission (including recording and FigJam board) is in Week 5.
