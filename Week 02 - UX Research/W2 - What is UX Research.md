UX Research is the systematic investigation of users, their needs, pain points, and behaviors to inform the design of user experiences. It is a critical component of the [[W1 - The Design Process]], particularly in the "Discover" and "Define" phases of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]], helping to ensure that designs are truly user-centered.

## Defining Research in the UX Context

* **General Definition of Research:** Creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge. It involves the collection, organization, and analysis of information to increase understanding of a topic or issue.
* **In Business:** Conducted to mitigate risks around the cost of building products/services.
* **In UX:** Conducted to understand the deeper needs of customers/users. UX research applies various research methods to gather insights that guide the design and development of products.
* **Goal:** To develop empathy with users and evaluate design concepts based on user feedback and behavior.

## Types of Research Sources

### 1. Primary Research
* **Definition:** Collecting new, original data directly from users or by observing their behavior. The researcher is the first to gather and analyze this data.
* **Methods:** [[W2 - User Interviews|User Interviews]], surveys, [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research|Workshops]]/focus groups, usability testing, observations, contextual inquiry.
* **Pros:** Data is specific to the research questions, provides deep insights, can uncover unexpected findings.
* **Cons:** Can be time-consuming and expensive.

### 2. Secondary Research
* **Definition:** Analyzing existing data and information that has already been collected by others. This is often referred to as "desk research."
* **Methods:** Reviewing academic papers (e.g., via Google Scholar), industry reports (e.g., Gartner, Forrester), competitor analysis, analyzing existing datasets (e.g., web analytics, social media analytics, complaints data), semiotic analysis.
* **Pros:** Can be quicker and less expensive than primary research, provides broad context, can help refine primary research questions.
* **Cons:** Data may not be directly applicable, might be outdated, or its quality/bias may be unknown.
* **Purpose:** Often used to complement primary research findings, providing broader context or triangulating results (see [[Week 03 - UX Analysis#3 Triangulation|W3 - Triangulation]]).

## The Role of Critical Thinking
* **Definition:** The process of assessing claims and making judgments on the basis of well-supported evidence.
* **Importance in UX Research:** Researchers must critically evaluate information gathered from users. Users may say one thing but do another, or their recall may be inaccurate.
* **UNSW Critical Thinking Guide Steps:**
    1.  What am I being asked to believe or accept?
    2.  What evidence is available to support the assertion?
    3.  Are there alternative ways of interpreting the evidence?
    4.  What additional evidence would help evaluate the alternatives?
    5.  What conclusions are most reasonable?
* **Application:** Questioning assumptions, looking for contradictions (e.g., a user says a task is easy but struggles to complete it), and seeking multiple sources of evidence to validate findings.

## Why Conduct UX Research?
* **Understand Users:** To gain insights into their behaviors, needs, characteristics, motivations, and pain points.
* **Prevent Designing for Ourselves:** To avoid assumptions and biases that lead to designs based on the designer's or business's perspective rather than the user's. This aligns with the core principle of [[W1 - UX, SD, and CX Concepts#1 Importance of Human-Centered Design|Human-Centered Design]].
* **Mitigate Risk:** Reduces the risk of building the wrong product or a product that users find unusable or unhelpful.
* **Develop Empathy:** Fosters a deeper connection and understanding of the user's perspective, leading to more thoughtful and effective design solutions.

## Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research

UX research employs both qualitative and quantitative methods, often in conjunction.

### Qualitative Research
* **Purpose:** To explore, investigate, understand, and expand the focus of inquiry. Aims to understand the "why" behind user behavior.
* **Data:** Descriptive, observational, non-numerical (e.g., interview transcripts, observation notes, user quotes).
* **Methods:** [[W2 - User Interviews|User Interviews]], [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research|Workshops]], focus groups, [[W2 - Qualitative Research Methods#2 Contextual Inquiry|Contextual Inquiry]], ethnographic studies, usability testing (observational aspects).
* **Analysis:** Involves interpreting themes, patterns, and narratives from the data.
* **Double Diamond Alignment:** Predominantly used in the **Discover** (to explore the problem) and **Develop** (to explore solutions) phases where divergent thinking is key.

### Quantitative Research
* **Purpose:** To measure, assess, confirm, justify, validate, and "close down" the inquiry. Aims to understand "how many" or "how much."
* **Data:** Numerical, measurable (e.g., survey ratings, task completion rates, A/B test conversion rates).
* **Methods:** [[W2 - Quantitative Research Methods#2 Surveys|Surveys]] (with closed-ended or scaled questions), [[W2 - Quantitative Research Methods#1 Card Sorting|Card Sorting]] (can have quantitative outputs), A/B testing, web analytics, eye-tracking.
* **Analysis:** Involves statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and significant differences.
* **Double Diamond Alignment:** Predominantly used in the **Define** (to prioritize problems) and **Deliver** (to test and validate solutions) phases where convergent thinking is applied.
* **Note:** In practice, methods are often mixed at each stage of the Double Diamond, with one approach being the primary focus.

## Ethical Considerations in UX Research
Ethical conduct is paramount in research involving human participants.

* **Consent:**
    * Always obtain informed consent from participants before they participate in any research activity.
    * Clearly explain the purpose of the research, what participation involves, how data will be used, and their rights (e.g., to withdraw).
    * This can be done via a signed consent form and/or verbal confirmation (especially before recording).
* **Privacy & Confidentiality:**
    * Protect participants' personally identifiable information (PII). Store data securely.
    * Anonymize or pseudonymize data where possible, especially in reports.
    * Avoid collecting unnecessary PII.
* **Transparency:**
    * Be upfront and clear about how research insights and results will be used (e.g., for product improvement, academic publication).
    * Transparency can motivate participants if they see how their input contributes.
* **"Get Out Of the Building" (GOOB):** A sentiment from Lean UX encouraging researchers to observe users in their natural environments. While valuable, it must always be conducted ethically (e.g., not recording or closely observing people without their knowledge and consent in private or semi-private settings).

## Planning UX Research Activities
The extent and type of research depend on project risk and problem clarity.

* **Risk:** The potential impact on the business or customer if the design idea is wrong.
* **Problem Clarity:** The level of existing evidence and understanding of the problem being solved.

A 2x2 matrix can help decide the research approach:
* **Low Risk, High Problem Clarity:** "Ship it and Measure" (e.g., use analytics post-launch).
* **Low Risk, Low Problem Clarity:** "Research Light" (some foundational research needed).
* **High Risk, High Problem Clarity:** "Design Heavy" (extensive design exploration and testing of solutions).
* **High Risk, Low Problem Clarity:** "Research Heavy" (significant discovery research needed to understand the problem).

## UX Research Tools
Various tools support the research process:
* **Active Research Tools (e.g., UserTesting):** For conducting remote moderated/unmoderated research like user interviews, click tests, prototype testing.
* **Insight Management / Repositories (e.g., Dovetail):** For storing, organizing, and analyzing research data and outputs.
* **Planning & Recruitment Tools (e.g., Askable, Prolific, Amazon Mechanical Turk - MTurk):** For recruiting, screening, and managing research participants. These platforms often offer features to incentivize participants and ensure data quality (e.g., attention checks, response time monitoring).
