This final week of the course bridges the academic learning with real-world industry practices in User Experience (UX) and Service Design (SD). It also provides crucial information and preparation for the final examination. Additionally, this week's tutorials are dedicated to group project presentations (workshop playbacks).

The lecture will touch upon how UX/SD research is initiated and conducted in professional settings, including stakeholder engagement and practical considerations for facilitating research activities like workshops. A significant portion will be dedicated to final exam structure, what to expect, how to prepare, and logistical details for the Inspera-based exam.
