## Accessing the Exam via Inspera

* **Platform:** The final exam uses the Inspera assessment platform.
* **Safe Exam Browser (SEB):**
    * Inspera will require the use of Safe Exam Browser (SEB) for this closed-book exam.
    * SEB is an application that locks down your computer, preventing access to other applications, websites, or your notes while it is running.
    * **Action Required:** You **must download and install the correct and latest version of SEB** onto the laptop you plan to bring to your exam.
    * If you have a previous version of SEB, you might need to uninstall it first before installing the version specified by UNSW for the current exam period.
* **Launching the Exam:**
    * On the exam day, you will first log into the Inspera website (`https://unsw.inspera.com/student`) using a standard web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).
    * Your specific exam test will then launch SEB automatically from within Inspera. You do not launch SEB directly first.

## Pre-Exam Technical Preparation

It is your responsibility to ensure your device is ready for the exam:

1.  **Familiarize Yourself with Inspera:**
    * Visit the Inspera Student exam website (link usually provided by UNSW Exams) for information, guides, and resources for on-campus Inspera exams.
2.  **Download and Install SEB:**
    * Download the correct version of SEB from the UNSW-provided links.
3.  **Take the SEB Practice Test:**
    * UNSW provides a generic "Student Practice Inspera Test with SEB" (`https://unsw.inspera.com/student#list/112563919` - link from slides, always check official UNSW comms for current links).
    * This test helps you check if SEB is installed correctly and if your laptop is compatible.
    * A generic password for practice tests is often provided (e.g., Test Password: `12345a`, Quit Password: `1234`).
    * **Recommendation:** Retest SEB functionality, perhaps on the day before the exam (e.g., May 14th, if the exam is May 15th), to ensure everything is working.
4.  **Check Timetable:** Carefully check your myUNSW timetable for the exact date, start time, and location of your exam, along with specific information about what materials are permitted.
5.  **UNSW Exams Team Emails:** Look out for emails from the UNSW Exams Team, especially if you have Educational Access Scheme (ELS) provisions.
6.  **Laptop Updates:**
    * Avoid triggering major operating system (Windows/Mac) updates or upgrades two days before the examination to ensure settings are not unexpectedly modified.
    * If you do update, re-run the SEB Practice Test.
7.  **IT Support:** If you have any technical questions or issues with SEB, contact UNSW IT walk-in services.

## What to Bring to the Exam (Mandatory Items)

The following items are **mandatory** for your on-campus Inspera invigilated exam:

1.  **UNSW Student ID Card (Physical Copy):**
    * A physical driver's license or passport will also be accepted if you don't have your student ID. Digital copies are not sufficient.
2.  **A Pen or Pencil:**
    * An ID form will need to be filled out.
    * **Crucially for this course:** Two sub-questions in the exam will require you to draw diagrams/artefacts on paper answer sheets provided by the examination team. These handwritten answers will be scanned and uploaded to Inspera for marking. A pen is preferable for clarity when scanned, but a pencil is acceptable. Bring an eraser if using a pencil.
3.  **A Laptop (Bring Your Own Device - BYOD):**
    * Ensure it meets hardware requirements (check UNSW exam pages).
    * Bring your **charger** (though access to power in the exam venue is not guaranteed, so ensure your laptop is fully charged).
    * If you are unable to bring your own device, you should arrange to borrow a laptop from the Law or Main UNSW Libraries well in advance.
4.  **Your Smartphone:**
    * Required for routine login to exam systems that are enabled with Single Sign-On (SSO) / Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Check MFA troubleshooting pages if needed.

## Recommended Additional Items

* **A Mouse for Your Laptop:** Many find this more comfortable than a trackpad for extended use.
* **Laptop Fully Charged:** As mentioned, power access is not guaranteed.
* **Laptop Adapter:** For charging if required and if power is available.

**Refer to the official UNSW Exams checklist for a comprehensive list of permitted and prohibited items:** `https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/exam/checklist` (always verify the current link).

## On the Day of the Exam

1.  **Arrive Early:** Arrive at your exam location at least 15 minutes before your exam start time. There will likely be an IT helpdesk to assist with any last-minute technical questions.
2.  **Connect to Uniwide Wi-Fi.**
3.  **Log into Inspera:** Go to `https://unsw.inspera.com/` (NOT directly into SEB). The test will launch SEB.

Being well-prepared technically will help reduce stress on exam day and allow you to focus on the exam content.
