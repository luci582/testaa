## Key Exam Details

* **Format:** The final exam will be a face-to-face examination held on the Kensington campus.
    * It will consist of a **2-hour Writing Time** plus an additional **15 minutes for Reading Time**.
* **Weighting:** The final exam accounts for **40%** of the overall course mark. The paper itself will be marked out of 100 points, which will then be scaled to the 40% weighting.
* **Date and Time (T1 2025 - Example from Slides):**
    * **Thursday, 15th May 2025**
    * **1:45 pm - 4:00 pm** (Australian Eastern Time Zone - AEST)
    * **Crucial Note:** Students **must double-check the definitive date, time, and venue** of their examination in their personal timetable on myUNSW, as the provided date is an example from the slides and subject to official confirmation.
* **Invigilation:** The examination is invigilated by the University Examination Unit, not by the course teaching staff.
* **Platform:** The exam will be conducted on the **Inspera** platform.

## Important Considerations

* **Strict Timing:** The examination duration is strictly enforced. The Inspera platform will automatically close after the allocated time has elapsed. Effective time management during the exam is essential.
* **Summative Assessment:** This is a final summative assessment, not an assignment.
    * No detailed marking criteria will be provided beforehand (beyond what's generally covered in learning outcomes).
    * There will be **NO qualitative feedback** provided on individual exam performance.
* **Grade Release:** Final grades (which include the exam mark) will be released as per the official university schedule. Numerical marks for the final exam itself will not be released on Moodle.
* **Special Consideration:**
    * If a student is unable to attend the exam due to illness or other serious circumstances, they must apply for Special Consideration through the official UNSW channels (Special Consideration Units).
    * Students should inform the lecturer (Dr. Maggie Wang) via email as a courtesy, but the formal request and approval process is managed by the Special Consideration Unit. Contacting teaching staff alone is not sufficient.

## Accessing the Exam Paper on the Day

* The exam is an invigilated, in-person exam on campus, delivered via the Inspera platform.
* Students will need to log into Inspera (specific URL: `https://unsw.inspera.com/student`) via a standard web browser. The Inspera test itself will then launch the Safe Exam Browser (SEB).

Students are strongly advised to carefully read all official communications from the UNSW Exams Team regarding their final examinations.
