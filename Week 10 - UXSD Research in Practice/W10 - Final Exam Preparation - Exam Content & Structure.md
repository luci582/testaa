* **Total Questions:** Three main questions.
* **Sub-Parts:** Some or all main questions will have sub-parts.

    * **Question 1:** Written question (25 marks total, e.g., 10 + 15 marks for sub-parts)
    * **Question 2:** Written question (20 marks total, e.g., 8 + 12 marks for sub-parts)
    * **Question 3:** Written question based on a case study (55 marks total, e.g., 10 + 5 + 10 + 15 + 15 marks for sub-parts)
* **Total Mark for Paper:** 100 marks (scaled to 40% of overall course grade).
* **Question Types:** Primarily short answer and problem-solving questions. No multiple-choice questions.

## Key Areas to Review & Understand

### 1. The Double Diamond Framework
* **Criticality:** A thorough understanding of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond model]] (Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver/Test) is essential.
* **Application:** Be prepared to discuss activities and artifacts associated with each stage.
    * *Discover:* Empathize, understand the problem (e.g., using [[Week 02 - UX Research|UX Research]] methods).
    * *Define:* Frame the problem, identify key opportunities (e.g., using [[W3 - Analysis and Synthesis in UX|analysis & synthesis]], [[W3 - Problem Framing|problem statements]]).
    * *Develop:* Ideate solutions, prototype concepts (e.g., using [[W4 - Ideation Techniques|ideation techniques]], [[W5 - Wireflows|wireframing & prototyping]]).
    * *Deliver (Test & Learn):* Test concepts with users, gather feedback, iterate (e.g., using [[W7 - Concept Testing|UX Testing]] methods).

### 2. Potential Exam Content Areas (Based on Lecture Slides & Transcript)

The exam may draw from a range of topics covered throughout the course, with an emphasis on application and understanding.

* **Theoretical Questions & Case Study Application:**
    * Defining concepts and providing examples.
    * Applying frameworks to given scenarios or a case study.
    * Drawing out artifacts (low-fidelity).
* **Drawing from P&P (Preparation & Participation) Tasks:** Tutorial preparation questions and in-class group activities are highly relevant.
* **Assignment Task Concepts:** Knowledge gained from completing assignments (especially the group workshop and individual design project) will be valuable.
    * [[W2 - Starting Your UX Research (Planning & Preparation)#Participant Recruitment Brief for Group Assignment|Participant criteria]] & recruitment.
    * [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research|Workshop]] / [[W2 - User Interviews|interview]] planning.
    * [[W3 - Analysis and Synthesis in UX|Synthesis & analysis]] of research data.
    * [[W5 - Wireframes|Wireframes]] (likely low-fidelity concepts).
    * [[W7 - Concept Testing|UX Testing]] approaches and concepts.
* **Core UX/SD Concepts:**
    * **[[W1 - Evaluating UX and Design#2 2 Jakob Nielsens 10 Usability Heuristics|Heuristic evaluation]]**: Understanding and applying heuristics (especially the 5 key ones for the course from Week 1). Be prepared to identify issues and suggest improvements based on heuristics.
    * **[[W2 - What is UX Research|Research methods]]**: Distinguishing between [[W2 - Quantitative Research Methods|quantitative and qualitative data]] and methods for collecting each.
    * **[[W4 - Design in the Real World|Design principles]] (real-world and digital)**: Understanding and applying these principles. Focus on the "so what?" aspect â€“ what are the implications if a principle is violated, and what are the recommendations?
    * **[[W4 - Ideation Techniques#Storyboarding in UX|Storyboards]]**: Understanding their purpose and how they are used.
    * **[[W8 - The 5Ps of Service Design|Service Design 5Ps]]**: People, Processes, Places, Products, Performance.
    * **[[W9 - What is a Service Blueprint|Service Blueprinting]]**: Understanding its components and purpose (drawing a full, complex blueprint is unlikely to be required due to time, but conceptual understanding is key). The transcript suggests this is important.
    * **[[W3 - Problem Framing#How Might We HMW Statements|How Might We statements]]**: Turning insights/pain points into actionable opportunities.

### 3. Drawing Requirements for the Exam
* The exam will include **two sub-questions** (within Question 3, the case study) that require students to **draw artifacts on paper answer sheets**.
* These will likely be **low-fidelity** drawings.
* Examples of what *could* be asked (speculative, based on course content and transcript hints):
    * Low-fidelity wireframes or a simple wireflow.
    * A basic service blueprint structure or a component of it based on a scenario.
    * Other simple diagrams taught or practiced in tutorials.
* The focus will be on demonstrating understanding of the artifact's purpose and structure, not artistic quality. Clarity and correct application of concepts are key.
* Ensure your drawing is readable when scanned. Using a pen is often recommended.

## What is LESS Likely to be Heavily Tested or Excluded

Based on the lecture slides and transcript:

* **Format Exclusions:**
    * No mid-to-high fidelity sketching will be required (drawings will be low-fidelity).
    * No complex calculations.
    * No academic referencing.
* **Specific Topics De-emphasized for Deep Testing (though conceptual understanding is still beneficial):**
    * [[W3 - Personas|Personas]] & [[W3 - Customer Journey Mapping|Customer Journey Maps]]: While very important in practice and for assignments, detailed creation of these might not be a primary exam focus due to having been assessed extensively. However, understanding their purpose and how they are derived from research is still relevant.
    * [[W4 - Design Patterns|Design Patterns]] & [[W4 - Design Systems|Design Systems]]: Conceptual understanding rather than detailed recall of specific libraries.
    * [[W9 - Service Design Principles & Capabilities|Service Design Capabilities]] (as a distinct list to memorize, though the principles themselves are important).

## General Tips for Answering Exam Questions

* **Always Use Examples:** When defining concepts or making arguments, support your points with relevant examples from personal experiences, course content, or the provided case study.
* **Focus on "So What?":** For principles and heuristics, explain the implications of them being met or violated and provide actionable recommendations.
* **Be Strategic with Time:** Allocate time based on the marks for each question. Consider starting with higher-mark questions or sections if allowed by the exam interface. The transcript suggested potentially starting with Question 3.
* **Clarity and Conciseness:** Get to the point. Use clear language. Bullet points can be effective for listing items or steps where appropriate.
* **Understand Mark Allocation:** If a question asks for a certain number of points (e.g., "describe 4 principles" for 5 marks), ensure you address that number. The extra mark might be for overall communication or depth.
* **Problem-Solving Focus:** Many questions will be about applying knowledge to solve a problem or analyze a situation, rather than just recalling definitions.

The key to success is understanding the core concepts and frameworks and being able to apply them critically to given scenarios. Reviewing tutorial tasks (P&P and in-class activities) and group assignment learnings will be particularly beneficial.
