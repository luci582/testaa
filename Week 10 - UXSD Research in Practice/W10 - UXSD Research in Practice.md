While academic settings provide foundational knowledge, applying User Experience (UX) and Service Design (SD) research in a professional industry context involves practical considerations, stakeholder management, and a focus on actionable outcomes. This note explores how research initiatives typically begin and are conducted in practice.

## How Do UX/SD Research Projects Start in Industry?

Research initiatives are often triggered by various factors:

* **Problem or Opportunity Identified:**
    * A known issue with an existing product or service (e.g., customer complaints, low conversion rates).
    * A new market opportunity or an unmet user need that the business wants to explore.
* **Business Investment in an Initiative:**
    * A strategic decision by the company to develop a new product, enter a new market, or significantly improve an existing service.
* **Hearing Complaints in Day-to-Day Life:**
    * Informal feedback or observations from customers, employees, or even personal experiences can highlight areas needing investigation.

## Initial Steps in Industry Research

Once a need for research is recognized, several initial analytical activities are common:

### 1. Current State Analysis
* **Objective:** To understand the existing experience and identify its strengths and weaknesses.
* **Activities:**
    * **Heuristics Analysis:** Evaluating existing products/services against established [[W1 - Evaluating UX and Design#1. Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics|Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics]].
    * **Review Legacy Products/Services:** Understanding the history and evolution of current offerings.
    * **Identify Gaps:** Pinpointing areas where the current experience falls short of user expectations or business goals.

### 2. Competitor Analysis
* **Objective:** To understand what key players in the market are doing.
* **Activities:**
    * Identifying direct and indirect competitors.
    * Analyzing their products, services, features, and user experiences.
    * Identifying industry best practices.
    * Learning from what has been working well or not so well for others.

## Key Sources of Information in Practice

Effective research relies on gathering information from diverse sources:

* **Business Stakeholders:**
    * **Product Owners (POs):** Provide vision, priorities, and business context for the product.
    * **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):** Offer deep knowledge in specific domains relevant to the project.
    * Understanding their goals and metrics for success.
* **Employees:**
    * **Front-stage (Customer-facing) Employees:** Offer insights into direct customer interactions, pain points, and common issues (e.g., sales, customer support).
    * **Back-stage Employees:** Provide understanding of internal processes, systems, and operational challenges that impact service delivery.
* **Customers and End Users:**
    * The primary source for understanding needs, behaviors, and pain points directly.
    * Consider a mix of participant types for a holistic view.
    * Decide whether to have separate research sessions with different user groups or mixed groups.
* **Existing Data Analytics:**
    * **Web Traffic:** Analyzing user behavior on websites (e.g., page views, bounce rates, navigation paths).
    * **Call Centre Traffic:** Reviewing reasons for calls, common issues, and customer complaints.
    * **Social Media Interactions:** Monitoring brand mentions, sentiment, and user discussions.
    * **Publicly Available Statistics:** Leveraging industry reports, census data, or other relevant public data.

## Preparing for Research Activities (e.g., Workshops)

Thorough preparation is key to successful research facilitation.

* **Be Prepared:**
    * **Set up the Activity Space:** Whether physical or digital.
        * *Physical:* Book a room, ensure whiteboards, markers, sticky notes are available.
        * *Digital:* Set up collaborative tools like [[W2 - Starting Your UX Research (Planning & Preparation)#Tool FigmaFigJam|FigJam]], Miro, Mural, or video conferencing (Teams, Zoom).
    * **Practice Run & Tech Test:** Do a dry run of activities and test all technology beforehand.
* **Everyone Has a Role to Play:** Effective research, especially workshops, is often a team effort. Clearly define responsibilities (similar to group work in academic settings).
    * **Meeting Organizer:** Handles logistics, scheduling, and communication.
    * **Facilitator:** Guides the session, manages activities, and ensures objectives are met.
    * **Note Taker:** Captures key discussions, decisions, and insights.
    * **Time Keeper:** Helps keep the session on schedule.
    * **Tech Set-up:** Ensures all digital tools and AV equipment are working.

## Facilitating Workshops Effectively in Industry

When facilitating [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research|workshops]] with stakeholders or users:

* **Choose Activities That Help You:**
    * **Set the Scene:**
        * Clearly state the workshop's purpose and what you are trying to find out.
        * Introductions ("who's who in the zoo") to help participants get to know each other.
        * Provide a clear agenda and instructions for all activities.
    * **Make Everyone Comfortable with Sharing:** Create a safe and open environment where all voices can be heard.
    * **Understand Stakeholders:**
        * Elicit business goals and key metrics for success.
        * Explore customer goals, attitudes, and current perceptions.
    * **Understand the Current Experience:**
        * Identify current joys (what's working well).
        * Uncover current pain points and frustrations.
        * Gather ideas on their "wish list" or even "crazy ideas" for improvement.

Conducting UX and SD research in practice requires a blend of methodological rigor, strong interpersonal and facilitation skills, and a pragmatic approach to gathering and using insights to drive design and business outcomes.
