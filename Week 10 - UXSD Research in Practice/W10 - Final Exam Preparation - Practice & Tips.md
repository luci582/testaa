This note offers practical advice and discusses example question areas to help students prepare for the INFS3700 final examination. The key is not just recalling information but applying concepts to scenarios and justifying design decisions.

## General Approach to Answering Questions

* **Understand the "So What?":** For many concepts (like heuristics, design principles), don't just define them. Explain their importance, the implications if they are not followed (negative impact), and what positive outcomes result from applying them. Provide recommendations.
* **Use Examples:** Always support your points and arguments with concrete examples. These can be drawn from:
    * Your own personal experiences with products and services.
    * Examples discussed in lectures or tutorials.
    * The provided case study in Question 3.
    * Well-known real-world applications (e.g., Uber, Starbucks, as mentioned in previous lectures).
* **Structure Your Answers:**
    * Get to the point, but ensure you cover the depth required by the question and marks allocated.
    * Use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate to present information clearly, especially if asked for multiple items or steps. This aids readability for markers.
* **Address All Parts of the Question:** Pay attention to multi-part questions and ensure each component is answered.
* **Time Management:** Be mindful of the marks allocated to each question/sub-question and distribute your time accordingly. The transcript suggests possibly tackling Question 3 (the case study with 55 marks) first.
* **Drawing Questions (Question 3):**
    * Focus on clarity and conveying the concept, not artistic perfection. Low-fidelity is expected.
    * Ensure drawings are readable, especially as they will be scanned. Using a pen might be better than a pencil for scan clarity.
    * The drawing should solve the problem presented in the case study, based on the artifact you are asked to draw.

## Practice Areas & Example Question Focus

The lecture highlighted several areas where students can practice their thinking, similar to potential exam questions.

### 1. Heuristics Analysis (from Week 1)
* **If a heuristic IS MET ("Software is forthcoming"):**
    * *We found that...* (e.g., "Software is forthcoming")
    * *...so what?* (Explain what this means in practice â€“ "It is proactive with helping users.") Provide examples.
* **If a heuristic IS NOT MET ("Software is not forthcoming"):**
    * *We found that...* (e.g., "Software is not forthcoming")
    * *...so what?* (Explain the negative impact on the user experience).
    * **Give recommendations:** How could the design be improved to meet this heuristic?
* **Key Heuristics to focus on (from course):**
    * Software is forthcoming
    * Software is self-confident
    * Software has visibility of system status
    * Software is matched to the real world
    * Software doesn't waste your time

### 2. Journey Maps & "How Might We" (HMW) Statements (from Week 3)
* **Connecting Pain Points to Opportunities:**
    * *We found that...* (Identify emotional lows/pain points from a hypothetical journey map)
        * Example: "Students don't have much visibility around events on campus."
        * Example: "Mentees and mentors are not compatible, and interactions drop off."
        * Example: "Job onboarding is confusing; there are too many checklists and outdated materials."
    * *...so what?* (Frame these as opportunities for design using [[W3 - Problem Framing#How Might We HMW Statements|How Might We (HMW) statements]])
        * Example: "How might we keep students updated with campus events, notifying them about activities of interest?"
        * Example: "How might we create matches based on compatibility and increase the duration of interactions between mentees and mentors?"
        * Example: "How might we create a source of truth that is easy to maintain to support job onboarding?"

### 3. Design Principles (from Week 4)
* Similar to heuristics:
    * **If a principle IS MET ("Design is perceivable and predictable"):**
        * *We found that...* ("Design is perceivable and predictable")
        * *...so what?* ("Information is grouped well and actions are clear.") Provide examples.
    * **If a principle IS NOT MET ("Design is not perceivable and predictable"):**
        * *We found that...* ("Design is not perceivable and predictable")
        * *...so what?* (Explain negative impact).
        * **Give recommendations.**
* **Key Design Principles to focus on (from course):**
    * Design is perceivable and predictable.
    * Design is consistent and conventional.
    * Design uses natural affordances.
    * Design provides feedback.
    * Design provides constraints.

### 4. Research Data & Metrics (from Weeks 2 & 7)
* **Interpreting Feedback:**
    * *We found that...* (Present hypothetical quantitative or qualitative feedback)
        * **Quantitative:** Direct/indirect success rates, ratings on scales, time to complete tasks.
        * **Qualitative:** What users liked/disliked, suggestions.
    * *...so what?* (What are the implications? How does this inform design?)
        * **If experience validated:** "High success rate due to X," "High confidence rating due to Y," "Customers liked A, B, C, and therefore..."
        * **If iteration needed:** "Low success rate due to Z," "Low confidence rating due to W," "Customers found P, Q, R confusing, and therefore..." (propose improvements).

## Example Practice Questions (from Lecture Slides)

These are short-answer, 10-mark style questions:

1.  **"Why is UX and SD design important for products and services? Define both roles and provide examples from your personal experiences."**
    * *Approach:* Define UX, define SD, explain their importance (linking to user satisfaction, business goals), provide distinct examples for each.
2.  **"What will you consider if you are conducting exploratory research? Give examples of 2 activities and 2 artefacts produced."**
    * *Approach:* Define exploratory research (understanding a problem, often qualitative). Considerations: research questions, target users, ethical considerations, [[W2 - Qualitative Research Methods|qualitative methods]]. Activities: e.g., [[W2 - User Interviews|user interviews]], [[W2 - Qualitative Research Methods#2 Contextual Inquiry|contextual inquiry]]. Artifacts: e.g., interview transcripts/summaries, [[W3 - Personas|personas]] (from synthesized data), [[W3 - Affinity Mapping|affinity diagrams]].
3.  **"What are some examples of quantitative vs qualitative data? How would you go about collecting both types of data?"**
    * *Approach:* Define each data type. Examples of Quantitative: task completion rates, survey ratings. Examples of Qualitative: interview quotes, observation notes. Collection methods: Quantitative (e.g., [[W2 - Quantitative Research Methods#2 Surveys|surveys with closed questions]], analytics), Qualitative (e.g., [[W2 - User Interviews|interviews]], [[W2 - Workshops in UX Research|workshops]]).

## Final Tips from Transcript

* **Consistency in Application:** For the case study (Question 3), ensure your solutions (e.g., HMW statements, problem statements, drawn artifacts) are consistent with each other and logically address the issues described in the case.
* **Prioritize Study:** Focus on tutorial P&P tasks and group assignment learnings/concepts, as these are highly relevant.
* **Memorization vs. Understanding:** While some memorization of frameworks/principles is needed (since it's a closed-book exam without direct access to notes/Google/AI), the emphasis is on *applying* this knowledge.
* **Closed Book Clarification:** "Closed book" means no notes, no Google, no AI (like ChatGPT). The Safe Exam Browser will restrict access.
* **Word Limits:** No strict word limits were set after the examination team asked for their removal. However, answers should be concise and to the point, guided by the mark allocation. Avoid overly long essays.

By practicing the application of course concepts to different scenarios and focusing on clearly articulating the "so what?" or value of each concept, students can prepare effectively for the problem-solving nature of the final exam.
