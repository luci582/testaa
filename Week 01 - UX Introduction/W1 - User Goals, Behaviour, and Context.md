To design effective and user-centered products and services, it's crucial to understand not just *what* users do, but *why* they do it and the circumstances surrounding their actions. This note explores the concepts of user goals, behaviours, mental models, and the context of use.

## The Problem with Software Development Focus

A common pitfall in product development is focusing too much on features rather than the underlying user goals the product is meant to support. This can lead to:

* **Solutions not designed:** The product might not actually solve the user's real problem.
* **Problems not identified:** The true needs and pain points of users may be overlooked.
* **Edge cases prioritized:** Too much effort might be spent on features for niche scenarios while core needs are unmet.
* **Products that are not self-explanatory, distracting, difficult to use, forgettable, and short-lived.**

In contrast, a **goal-focused approach** aims to create products that are:
* Self-explanatory and simple in appearance.
* Easy to figure out and use.
* Memorable, delightful, and continue to evolve over time.

## 1. User Goals

* **Definition:** The final result or outcome that a user expects to achieve by completing a process or interacting with a product/service. Goals are the "why" behind user actions.
* **Nature:** Goals are relatively stable and represent what the user ultimately wants to accomplish, independent of a specific technology or interface.
* **Influence:** Goals are influenced by existing behaviours and mental models.
* **Design Implication:** Products should be designed to help users achieve their goals efficiently and effectively. This involves understanding the tasks users need to perform to reach those goals.
* **Example (Food Delivery App):**
    * **User Goal:** "I want to eat dinner tonight without cooking."
    * **User Goal:** "I want to prepare a healthy breakfast for tomorrow morning."
    * **User Goal:** "I want to find a restaurant that offers vegan options near me."
* **In Business Analysis:** User goals are often described as User Stories (e.g., "As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [benefit/goal]").

## 2. User Behaviours

* **Definition:** The observable actions, reactions, and ways users interact with the world, including products and services, as they work towards their goals. Behaviours are the "how" users do things.
* **Influence:** Behaviours are shaped by habits, past experiences, mental models, and the current context.
* **Design Implication:** Observing and understanding user behaviours provides critical insights into how users currently solve problems, where they encounter difficulties, and what their preferences are.
* **Example (Continuing Food Delivery App):**
    * **Behaviour related to "I want to eat dinner tonight without cooking":**
        * "I often order takeaway when I'm working late because I'm too tired to cook." (Habitual behaviour influenced by context).
        * "I usually browse through multiple restaurants before deciding." (Exploratory behaviour).
    * **Behaviour related to "I want to prepare a healthy breakfast for tomorrow morning":**
        * "I have porridge every morning, so I look for ingredients for that." (Routine behaviour).
        * "I prefer to order groceries online the day before to save time." (Planning behaviour).

## 3. Mental Models

* **Definition:** An individual's internal, often simplified, representation of how something works in the real world or how a system operates. These are beliefs and ideas formed consciously or unconsciously based on past experiences.
* **Function:** Mental models act as "shortcuts for reasoning." They guide users' thoughts, expectations, and behaviours when interacting with a new or familiar system. Users predict how a system will behave based on their mental model.
* **Formation:** Rooted in biological observations (e.g., understanding physical objects) and behavioral studies (e.g., learning from interactions).
* **Design Implication:**
    * When a system's design (the "Design Model") aligns with a user's existing mental model, the system will feel intuitive and easy to use.
    * When there's a mismatch, users experience confusion, frustration, and errors.
    * Designers should strive to understand users' existing mental models or design systems that help users quickly form accurate new ones.
* **Example (Continuing Food Delivery App):**
    * **Mental Model:** "I expect to be able to filter restaurant options by cuisine type, price range, and delivery time." (Based on experiences with other similar apps or e-commerce sites).
    * **Mental Model:** "I assume I can pay with my credit card securely within the app, without needing cash."
    * **Mental Model:** "Ordering from local restaurants is likely better for the community and might mean faster delivery." (A belief that influences choice).
* **Discrepancy:** The difference between "How I *think* it works" (Mental Model) and "How it *actually* works" (Design Model) can be a major source of usability problems.

## 4. Context of Use

* **Definition:** The specific circumstances and environment in which a user interacts with a product or service. Context is critical because it can significantly alter user needs, behaviours, and goals.
* **Elements of Context:**
    * **Physical Environment:** Location (e.g., at home, in the office, on public transport), noise levels, lighting.
    * **Social Environment:** Are other people present? Is the task collaborative or individual? Are there social pressures?
    * **Temporal Environment:** Time of day, day of the week, available time, deadlines.
    * **Technological Environment:** Device being used (e.g., desktop, mobile, tablet), internet connectivity, other software being used concurrently.
    * **User's State:** Emotional state (e.g., stressed, relaxed), cognitive load, physical condition (e.g., tired, distracted).
* **Design Implication:** Designers must always be aware of the potential contexts in which their product will be used and design for flexibility and resilience. A feature that works well in a quiet office might be unusable on a noisy train.
* **Example (Continuing Food Delivery App):**
    * **Context 1:** User is at home, 9:45 PM on a Tuesday evening, tired after a long day.
        * *Likely Goals/Behaviours:* Wants something quick and easy, not much mental effort, familiar options might be preferred.
    * **Context 2:** User is planning for the week, 5:30 AM on a Wednesday morning, feeling organized.
        * *Likely Goals/Behaviours:* Might be looking for healthier options, scheduling deliveries, comparing prices, more willing to explore new restaurants.
    * **Context 3:** User is on a moving bus with patchy internet.
        * *Design Consideration:* The app should handle poor connectivity gracefully, perhaps allowing offline Browse or saving order progress.

Understanding these four elements—Goals, Behaviours, Mental Models, and Context—is essential for empathizing with users and forms the bedrock of user-centered design. This understanding informs every stage of the [[W1 - The Design Process]].
