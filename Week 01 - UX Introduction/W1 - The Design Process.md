# W1 - The Design Process

Effective User Experience (UX) design is not a haphazard activity but follows structured, iterative processes. This note introduces several key models and frameworks that describe and guide the design process, emphasizing that design is fundamentally about problem-solving.

## Design is Problem Solving

At its core, the design process is a systematic approach to solving problems. It's about understanding user needs, identifying challenges, exploring potential solutions, and refining those solutions through iteration and feedback.

## Visualizing the Design Journey

### 1. The Design Squiggle
* **Concept:** A simple yet powerful illustration (often attributed to Damien Newman) that conveys the feeling and nature of the design process.
* **Journey:** It starts "messy" and uncertain, with a wide range of possibilities and initial confusion. Through research, exploration, prototyping, and testing, the process gradually becomes more focused and clear, eventually converging on a single point of clarity or a well-defined solution.
* **Navigation:** This journey is navigated using specific Mindsets (e.g., curiosity, empathy), Stages (e.g., discover, define), and Activities (e.g., user interviews, brainstorming).
* **Key Takeaway:** Embraces the initial ambiguity and iterative nature of finding effective design solutions.

## Frameworks for Structuring Design

### 2. The Double Diamond Model
A widely adopted framework (popularized by the UK Design Council) that visualizes the design process in four distinct phases, organized into two "diamonds" representing divergence and convergence.

* **Diamond 1: Problem Space - "Design the Right Thing"**
    1.  **Discover (Diverge):**
        * **Goal:** To understand the problem space deeply and broadly. Start with an initial idea or problem.
        * **Activities:** User research (interviews, observations, surveys), market research, competitor analysis, gathering insights.
        * **Outcome:** A broad understanding of user needs, pain points, context, and opportunities. *Insight into the Problem.*
    2.  **Define (Converge):**
        * **Goal:** To synthesize the findings from the Discover phase and narrow down to a clear, actionable problem definition or design challenge.
        * **Activities:** Analyzing research data, creating personas, developing user journey maps, identifying key insights, formulating a specific problem statement.
        * **Outcome:** A well-defined scope and focus for the design effort. *Problem Definition.*

* **Diamond 2: Solution Space - "Design Things Right"**
    3.  **Develop/Ideate (Diverge):**
        * **Goal:** To explore a wide range of potential solutions to the defined problem.
        * **Activities:** Brainstorming, sketching, storyboarding, creating multiple concepts, developing low-fidelity prototypes.
        * **Outcome:** A diverse set of potential solutions. *Potential Solutions.*
    4.  **Deliver/Test (Converge):**
        * **Goal:** To test and refine the potential solutions to arrive at the most effective one that meets user needs and business goals.
        * **Activities:** Creating high-fidelity prototypes, usability testing with users, gathering feedback, iterating on designs, preparing for implementation.
        * **Outcome:** A validated solution that works and is ready for launch or further development. *Solutions that Work & Receive Feedback.*

* **Key Mindsets:**
    * **Divergent Thinking:** Exploring many possible ideas, thinking broadly, and generating options (characteristic of Discover and Develop phases).
    * **Convergent Thinking:** Analyzing and synthesizing information to select the best approach and narrow down options (characteristic of Define and Deliver phases).

### 3. Design Thinking Framework
A human-centered, iterative approach to problem-solving and innovation, commonly associated with IDEO. While specific stage names can vary, a common 5-stage model includes:

1.  **Empathize:**
    * **Goal:** To gain a deep understanding of the users' needs, motivations, experiences, and problems from their perspective.
    * **Activities:** User interviews, observations, ethnographic studies, creating empathy maps.
2.  **Define:**
    * **Goal:** To clearly articulate the core problem(s) or needs identified during the empathize stage, framing them in a user-centered way.
    * **Activities:** Synthesizing research, defining user personas, crafting problem statements or Point of View (POV) statements.
3.  **Ideate:**
    * **Goal:** To generate a broad range of creative ideas and potential solutions to the defined problem.
    * **Activities:** Brainstorming sessions, "How Might We" questions, sketching, mind mapping.
4.  **Prototype:**
    * **Goal:** To create tangible, low-cost versions of potential solutions that can be tested. Prototypes are used to explore and communicate ideas.
    * **Activities:** Building paper prototypes, wireframes, interactive mockups, role-playing scenarios.
5.  **Test:**
    * **Goal:** To gather feedback from users on the prototypes to learn what works, what doesn't, and how to improve the solutions.
    * **Activities:** Usability testing, A/B testing, user feedback sessions.

* **Iterative Nature:** The Design Thinking process is not strictly linear. Teams often revisit earlier stages as they learn more.

### 4. DVF (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility) Venn Diagram
A framework for evaluating the potential success and sustainability of an innovative idea or solution by considering three critical dimensions:

* **Desirability (Users/Customers):**
    * **Question:** Do users need or want this? Does it solve a real problem or fulfill a genuine desire for them?
    * **Focus:** Human-centeredness, user needs, emotional appeal.
* **Viability (Business):**
    * **Question:** Does this solution make business sense? Can it generate revenue, reduce costs, or align with strategic goals? Is there a sustainable business model?
    * **Focus:** Business goals, market potential, profitability, sustainability.
* **Feasibility (Technology):**
    * **Question:** Can we technically build and deliver this solution with available resources, technology, and expertise?
    * **Focus:** Technical capabilities, available resources, existing infrastructure, time constraints.
* **Innovation 'Sweet Spot':** The most successful and sustainable innovations are typically found at the intersection of all threeâ€”they are desirable to users, viable for the business, and feasible to implement.

## Benefits and Drawbacks of Design Processes

* **Benefits:**
    * Product has a clear objective view.
    * Product can be visualized in high-fidelity (through prototyping).
    * Process has a natural, understandable structure.
    * Ideas can be iterated upon cheaply (especially with low-fidelity prototypes).
    * DVF (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility) can be considered equally.
    * Mitigates the risk of building something that isn't needed or wanted.
    * Builds collaboration across multiple disciplines.
* **Drawbacks:**
    * Can be hard to generate initial buy-in from stakeholders unfamiliar with the process.
    * Takes a concerted effort to plan, facilitate, and manage effectively.

## Evolution and Variations

Design processes are not static. Many variations and adaptations exist to suit different contexts and organizational needs, such as:

* **Design Research Process:** More emphasis on the upfront research phases.
* **Lean UX (Build-Measure-Learn):** Focuses on rapid iteration, minimum viable products (MVPs), and learning from user data.
* **Design Sprints (e.g., Google Ventures Design Sprint):** A time-constrained, five-phase process (often 5 days) that incorporates design thinking to quickly move from problem to tested prototype. Key characteristics include being focused on a specific target, requiring commitment from various parts of the organization, and often starting with analog (non-digital) methods for ideation.

## Agile Practices in Design

Modern design processes often incorporate Agile principles and practices to enhance flexibility, collaboration, and responsiveness.

* **Examples:** Daily stand-ups, design retrospectives, frequent customer testing, working in sprint cadences.
* **Synergy:** Agile methodologies (covered in courses like INFS2603 and INFS3605) complement design thinking by providing a framework for managing the iterative development and delivery of solutions.
* **Best Approach:** Blended approaches, combining the strengths of design thinking and agile practices, often work best, especially when dealing with ambiguity and complex problems.
