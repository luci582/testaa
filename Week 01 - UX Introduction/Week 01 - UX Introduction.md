This first week lays the groundwork for the entire course, introducing the core concepts of User Experience (UX) design. We will explore what UX is, how it relates to and differs from Service Design (SD) and Customer Experience (CX), and begin to understand the critical importance of a human-centered approach.

Key learning areas for this week include methods for evaluating UX and designs, the significance of understanding user goals, behaviors, and the context of their interactions, and an initial overview of the structured design processes that guide UX work.

## Key Topics for Week 1

This week's content is broken down into the following key areas:

* [[W1 - UX, SD, and CX Concepts]]: Defining User Experience, Service Design, and Customer Experience, and understanding their interrelations. This also covers the UX Hierarchy of Needs and the balance of Aesthetic vs. Functional design.
* [[W1 - Evaluating UX and Design]]: Exploring how UX can be objectively evaluated, focusing on Heuristic Evaluation, including Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics, Krug's principles, and the key combined heuristics for this course. Natural Mapping and Affordances are also introduced.
* [[W1 - User Goals, Behaviour, and Context]]: Understanding the critical elements that inform user-centered design: what users are trying to achieve (goals), how they act (behaviours), their underlying beliefs about how things work (mental models), and the circumstances of their interactions (context).
* [[W1 - The Design Process]]: An introduction to structured approaches for tackling design challenges, including the Design Squiggle, the Double Diamond model, the Design Thinking framework, the DVF (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility) framework, and the role of Agile practices.
