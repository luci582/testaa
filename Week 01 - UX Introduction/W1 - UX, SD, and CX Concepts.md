## Core Definitions and Distinctions

Understanding the nuances between UX, SD, and CX is foundational.

### 1. User Experience (UX)
* **Definition:** Encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with a company, its services, and its products. Specifically, it focuses on how a person *feels* when interacting with a particular product or digital touchpoint.
* **Scope:** Primarily concerned with digital touchpoints such as applications, websites, and digital payment systems.
* **Example:** The ease of navigating a mobile banking app, the intuitiveness of a self-checkout kiosk at a supermarket, or the clarity of information on a course registration website.
* **Key Question:** How does the user feel while using this specific interface/product?
* **Relation to Course:** A core focus for the initial weeks. See [[INFS3700 UX & IT Service Design - Main Summary#Foundations of UX]].

### 2. Service Design (SD)
* **Definition:** Takes a holistic view of the customer's experience, considering all online and offline interactions involved in a service. It is about the intentional and thoughtful organization of people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service to improve its quality and the interaction between the service provider and its customers.
* **Scope:** Broader than UX. It encompasses the entire customer journey and all touchpoints (digital, physical, human interaction). A single service can involve multiple UX components.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):**
    * **UX elements:** Mobile ordering app, website, digital menu board, payment terminal.
    * **SD elements:** All UX elements PLUS the in-store greeting by staff, the ambiance and layout of the shop, the waiting process for the coffee, the way staff handle orders and interact, the cleanliness of the tables, and even the process for handling complaints.
* **Mantra (Mark Fonteijn):** "When you have two coffee shops right next to each other, each selling the exact same coffee for the exact same price, Service Design is the reason you go into one coffee shop and not another."
* **Further Exploration:** Covered in detail from [[Week 08 - Service Design Introduction]] (to be populated).

### 3. Customer Experience (CX)
* **Definition:** The broadest of the three concepts. CX is the overall perception a customer has of a company or its brand based on all their interactions and touchpoints over the entire duration of their relationship. It's the sum total of all experiences.
* **Scope:** Encompasses every interaction, from initial awareness (e.g., advertising, word-of-mouth) through engagement, purchase, use, and post-purchase support. It also includes perceptions not directly tied to service interaction, like brand reputation or company values.
* **Example (Coffee Shop):**
    * Includes all UX and SD elements PLUS: the brand's marketing, its social media presence, its ethical sourcing policies (if known to the customer), the perceived value for money, and the emotional connection (or lack thereof) the customer feels towards the brand. A customer might choose one coffee shop over another because it offers specific milk alternatives that align with their dietary preferences or ethical stance, even before directly interacting with the service.
* **Key Element:** The overall "vibe" and brand association.

### Visualizing the Relationship
* **UX:** Often discrete digital interface solutions. Can be seen as various shapes and forms (different devices, systems).
* **SD:** An inner ring that encompasses and orchestrates multiple UXs and other touchpoints to create a cohesive service.
* **CX:** The outer ring, representing the sum of all perceptions and interactions with the company, including SD and multiple UXs.

## Key Supporting Concepts

### 1. Importance of Human-Centered Design
* **Core Principle:** The philosophy of designing products, services, and systems with a primary focus on the *end-users* â€“ their needs, limitations, behaviors, and preferences.
* **Contrast:** Moves away from designing based on the designer's personal taste, assumptions, or solely on business/technical requirements without user validation.
* **Impact:** Results in products that are more intuitive, efficient, enjoyable, and ultimately, more successful in meeting user needs and business goals.
* **Connection:** This is a central tenet of the entire course, as noted in [[INFS3700 UX & IT Service Design - Main Summary#Overarching Themes & Core Competencies]].

### 2. UX Hierarchy of Needs (Aaron Walter)
This model, inspired by Maslow's hierarchy of needs, outlines levels that a design should strive to achieve for a positive user experience:
1.  **Functional (Base):** The design must work and meet basic functional requirements. Does it do what it's supposed to do?
2.  **Reliable:** The design must perform consistently and accurately. Can users depend on it?
3.  **Usable:** The design must be easy and intuitive to learn and use. Can users figure it out and accomplish their tasks efficiently?
4.  **Pleasurable (Peak):** The design should evoke positive emotions and be enjoyable to use, going beyond mere functionality. Does it delight the user? This is the "cherry on top."

### 3. Experience Design: Aesthetic vs. Functional Design
Effective experience design successfully integrates both aesthetic and functional aspects:
* **Aesthetic Design:**
    * **Focus:** The visual appeal, look and feel, and sensory qualities of a product or interface.
    * **Examples:** The choice of colors, typography, imagery, layout, the tactile feel of a physical product, the sound of an alert.
    * **Impact:** Can create initial attraction, convey brand identity, and evoke emotion.
* **Functional Design:**
    * **Focus:** The underlying structure, components, and mechanisms that enable a product or service to perform its intended tasks.
    * **Examples:** The architecture of an app, the algorithms powering a search engine, the mechanical engineering of a car, the efficiency of backend systems.
    * **Impact:** Determines whether the product actually works, is reliable, and performs efficiently.
* **Experience Design (The Synthesis):**
    * **Focus:** The overall quality of the user's interaction and the memories and feelings it creates.
    * **Achieved by:** Seamlessly blending aesthetic appeal with robust functionality. A car that looks beautiful but drives poorly offers a bad experience; an app that is highly functional but ugly and confusing also offers a bad experience. True experience design ensures both aspects work in harmony.
