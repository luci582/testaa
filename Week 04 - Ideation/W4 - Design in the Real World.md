Good design isn't limited to digital interfaces; its principles are evident in the everyday objects and systems we interact with. Understanding these foundational principles helps create experiences that are intuitive, efficient, and satisfying, whether physical or digital. This note covers five core design principles applicable to "real-world" design.

## Five Core Design Principles in the Real World

These principles help ensure that objects and systems are easy to understand and use:

### 1. Perceivable and Predictable
* **Principle:** Users should be able to easily perceive how to use an object or system, and its behavior should be predictable based on its appearance and common conventions.
* **Key Elements for Digital Interfaces (often derived from this principle):**
    * **Chunking (Input Groups):** Breaking down information or input fields into smaller, logically grouped chunks makes them easier to process and understand. (e.g., separating personal information from vehicle information on a form).
    * **Field Labels:** Clearly labeling input fields so users know what information is required.
    * **Alignment:** Consistent alignment of elements (e.g., left-aligned labels and fields) creates a clear visual path and improves scannability.
    * **Visual Hierarchy:** Arranging elements to show their relative importance. More important elements should be more prominent (e.g., using size, color, contrast). This guides the user's attention.
    * **Call to Action (CTA):** Clear, prominent buttons or links that indicate the primary action to be taken.
* **Example (Newspaper Layout):** Newspapers use visual hierarchy (headlines, subheadings, columns, image placement) and chunking (articles, sections) to make information perceivable and predictable for readers.
* **Example (Forms):** Grouping related fields (like "Personal Information") makes a long form less daunting and easier to follow.

### 2. Consistent and Conventional
* **Principle:** Designs should be consistent in their appearance and behavior, and they should follow established conventions that users are already familiar with.
* **Design Consistency:** Making elements uniform – having them look and behave the same way throughout a product or system. This breeds familiarity and trust.
    * *Visual Consistency:* Using the same colors, fonts, and styles for similar elements.
    * *Functional Consistency:* Similar controls behaving predictably (e.g., all "play" buttons look and function similarly).
* **Design Conventions:** These are widely accepted models or standards that govern the look and feel of common interactions or elements. Users expect certain things to work in certain ways based on their past experiences.
    * *Examples:* A play button (triangle) is universally understood for media playback. A microwave oven typically has a numerical keypad and a start button. Music player interfaces often have similar controls for play, pause, skip, and volume.
* **Benefit:** Reduces learning curve and makes interfaces more intuitive. See also [[W4 - Digital UX Design Principles#Jakob s Law of the Internet User Experience|Jakob's Law]].

### 3. Use Natural Affordances
* **Principle:** The design of an object should inherently suggest how it is to be used. An "affordance" is a property or feature of an object that presents a prompt on what can be done with it.
* **Don Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things":** This book extensively discusses affordances.
* **Perceived Affordances:** What the user *perceives* can be done with an object based on its visual cues.
    * *Example (Norman Doors):* A door with a flat plate *affords* pushing, while a door with a handle *affords* pulling. When these affordances are mismatched with the actual operation (e.g., a handle on a push door), it leads to confusion – these are often called "Norman Doors."
* **In Digital Design:** Buttons should look clickable, scrollbars should suggest dragging, etc.
* **Goal:** To make interactions intuitive, requiring minimal thought or instruction. See also [[W1 - Evaluating UX and Design#Natural Mapping Affordances|Natural Mapping & Affordances]].

### 4. Provide Feedback
* **Principle:** Good interaction design requires the system to provide clear, obvious, visible, and understandable reactions to user actions. Feedback confirms that an action has been received and indicates the outcome or current status.
* **Characteristics of Good Feedback:**
    * **Obvious & Visible:** Users should easily notice the feedback.
    * **Understandable:** The meaning of the feedback should be clear.
    * **Timely:** Feedback should occur promptly after the user's action.
* **Examples:**
    * **Physical:** A light switch clicking and the light turning on/off. An elevator button lighting up when pressed.
    * **Digital:** A button changing appearance when clicked (e.g., looking depressed), a success message after submitting a form ("Whoops! Something went wrong" vs. "Success!"), loading indicators, sound cues.
* **Importance:** [[W1 - Evaluating UX and Design#1 Visibility of System Status|Visibility of System Status]] is a key usability heuristic.

### 5. Provide Constraints
* **Principle:** Constraints limit the range of possible actions or choices a user can make, guiding them towards correct usage and preventing errors.
* **Purpose:** To simplify decision-making, reduce the chance of errors, and make the system easier to learn and use.
* **Examples:**
    * **Physical:** An elevator only allowing you to select valid floor numbers. A USB plug only fitting one way into a port.
    * **Digital:**
        * **Form Validation:** Disabling a "submit" button until all required fields are filled correctly (e.g., an email field requires a valid email format). Error messages for unfilled or incorrectly filled fields guide the user.
        * **Dropdown Menus:** Constraining choices to a predefined list. A "Select all" option can be a useful constraint within this.
        * **Disabled Options:** Graying out menu items or buttons that are not currently applicable.
* **Benefit:** Helps prevent errors and makes interactions more efficient by guiding the user.

Understanding and applying these real-world design principles provides a solid foundation for creating more effective and user-friendly digital experiences, which will be explored further in [[W4 - Digital UX Design Principles]].
