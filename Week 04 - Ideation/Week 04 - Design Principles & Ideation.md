This week shifts our focus towards the foundational principles that underpin effective design, both in the physical and digital realms, and then moves into the crucial process of ideation. Understanding these principles helps in creating interfaces and experiences that are intuitive, consistent, and user-friendly. Ideation techniques will then equip us to generate creative solutions based on the problems and opportunities identified in earlier research and analysis phases. This marks a transition towards the "Develop" phase of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]].

The lecture will cover five core design principles applicable in the real world, specific digital UX design principles (such as consistency, sensory appeal, anchoring, chunking, visual hierarchy, label alignment, error handling, and CTAs), designing effective navigation, the concept of design patterns, and the role of design systems. Finally, we will explore ideation techniques, including "How Might We" statements and storyboarding.

## Key Topics for Week 4

This week's content is broken down into the following key areas:

* [[W4 - Design in the Real World]]: Examining five fundamental design principles that apply broadly to everyday objects and experiences.
* [[W4 - Digital UX Design Principles]]: Focusing on principles specifically relevant to digital interfaces, including page elements, consistency, sensory appeal, anchoring, chunking, visual hierarchy, label alignment, error handling, Call to Actions (CTAs), and other laws like Hick's Law, Jakob's Law, and Fitts's Law.
* [[W4 - Designing Navigation]]: Understanding Information Architecture (IA) as the foundation for clear and intuitive navigation in digital products.
* [[W4 - Design Patterns]]: Exploring reusable visual solutions to common design problems, promoting consistency and reducing cognitive load.
* [[W4 - Design Systems]]: Discussing comprehensive collections of tools, principles, and reusable components (like pattern libraries and style guides) that enable consistent and efficient design and development at scale. Examples include Google's Material Design, iOS Human Interface Guidelines, and Microsoft's Inclusive Design.
* [[W4 - Ideation Techniques]]: Introducing methods for generating creative solutions to design challenges, including "How Might We" statements, Crazy 8s, Parallel Worlds, and storyboarding.

## Assignment Focus
* **Group Project Progress:** Groups are expected to make adjustments to their workshop plans based on tutor feedback received in Week 3 and proceed to run their 4C workshops with 6-8 participants during Weeks 4-5.
* **Final Submission (Week 5):** Reminder that the final group project submission (PowerPoint, FigJam link, Workshop recording) is due in Week 5.
