Design patterns in UX are optimized, reusable, and conventional visual solutions to common, recurring design problems encountered in user interfaces. They promote consistency, reduce cognitive load for users, and streamline the design and development process.

## What are Design Patterns?

* **Definition:** Proven, generalizable solutions for commonly occurring design problems within a given context. They are like blueprints for interface elements or interactions.
* **Purpose:**
    * **Consistency:** Ensure that similar problems are solved in similar ways across an interface or multiple products, making the user experience predictable. This is especially important given the variety of interfaces users interact with daily.
    * **Efficiency:** Save design and development time by providing ready-made solutions instead of reinventing the wheel.
    * **Usability:** Leverage solutions that have been tested and proven to be effective, often reducing user friction and cognitive load.
    * **Shared Language:** Provide a common vocabulary for designers and developers.
* **Scope (What they address):** Can relate to layout, icons, text presentation, interaction behaviors, sound, and tone of voice.
* **Foundation (How they are developed):** Based on established [[W4 - Digital UX Design Principles|design principles]] and [[W1 - Evaluating UX and Design#Heuristic Evaluation|heuristics]].
* **Goal (Why they are used):** To reduce friction, lower cognitive load for users, and improve overall user wellbeing and satisfaction by making interfaces intuitive.

## Conventions as Widely Adopted Design Patterns

When a design pattern becomes so widely adopted and understood by users that it's the expected way to interact with a certain element or perform a task, it becomes a **convention**.
* **Example:** The "shopping cart" icon is a convention for e-commerce sites. A magnifying glass icon is a convention for search functionality.
* **Importance:** Following conventions helps users leverage their existing knowledge from other applications, as per [[W4 - Digital UX Design Principles#Jakob s Law of the Internet User Experience|Jakob's Law]].

## Example of a Design Pattern: The Card
Cards are a very common UI design pattern used to group related information in a digestible, container-like format.
* **Typical Elements within a Card Pattern:**
    1.  **Image:** A relevant visual.
    2.  **Heading:** A title for the content within the card.
    3.  **Description:** A brief summary or more details.
    4.  **Primary Call to Action (CTA):** A button or link for the main action related to the card.
    5.  **Subheading (Optional):** Additional context or categorization.
    6.  **Kebab Menu (or other secondary actions menu):** An icon (often three vertical dots) that reveals less frequently used options related to the card (e.g., share, edit, delete).

## Pattern Library

* **Definition:** A centralized, curated collection of design patterns, components, elements, and templates used by designers and developers within an organization. It's a resource for daily design work.
* **Purpose:**
    * To ensure consistency and reusability of design solutions across products and platforms.
    * To document how and when to use specific patterns.
    * To speed up the design and development process.
* **Relation to Design Systems:** A pattern library is often a core component of a larger [[W4 - Design Systems|Design System]].
* **Typical Structure of a Pattern Library (as part of a Design System):**
    * **Building Blocks (Foundations):**
        * Color Palettes
        * Typography scales and rules
        * Grid Definitions
        * Icons
    * **Elements:** Basic UI components like buttons, input fields, labels.
    * **Components:** More complex UI elements made up of multiple elements, designed for a specific purpose (e.g., a search bar component, a card component).
    * **Modules/Blocks:** Sections of an interface made up of multiple components (e.g., a product listing module).
    * **Templates:** Page-level layouts that define the structure for different types of content.
    * **Style Guide (Documentation):**
        * Rules for usage.
        * Design principles.
        * Implementation guidelines (for developers).
        * Editorial guidelines (for content and tone).

Using established design patterns and contributing to or leveraging a pattern library helps teams create more consistent, usable, and efficient user experiences.
