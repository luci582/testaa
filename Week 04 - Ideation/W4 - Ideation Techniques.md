Ideation is the creative process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas. In the context of UX design, it typically occurs after the problem has been well-defined through research and analysis ([[Week 03 - UX Analysis]]). It's a core part of the "Develop" (or "Ideate") phase in the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]] model, focusing on exploring a wide range of potential solutions to the identified user problems and [[W3 - Problem Framing|design challenges]].

## The Nature of Ideation

* **Iterative Process:** Ideation is not a one-time event but an ongoing process that involves building upon and combining ideas.
* **Setting the Space:** Creating an environment conducive to creativity is important. This includes the physical or digital space, the tools or activities used, and managing energy levels.
* **Individual vs. Group Ideation:**
    * **Designing on Your Own:**
        * **Pros:** Freedom and time to think deeply, space for individual brainstorming without immediate judgment.
    * **Designing with Others (Group Ideation):**
        * **Key Principles for Effective Group Ideation:**
            * **Defer Judgement:** Avoid criticizing ideas initially to encourage free flow.
            * **Encourage Wild Ideas:** Outlandish ideas can sometimes spark practical solutions.
            * **Build on Ideas of Others ("Yes, and..."):** Improve and combine concepts.
            * **Stay Focused on the Topic:** Keep discussions relevant to the [[W3 - Problem Framing|"How Might We"]] statement or design challenge.
            * **Be Visual:** Sketch ideas, use diagrams.
            * **Go for Quantity:** Generate as many ideas as possible initially; filter and refine later.
* **Atmosphere:** Fun, snacks, and even a playlist can help create a positive and creative atmosphere.

## Common Ideation Techniques

### 1. "How Might We" (HMW) Statements
* **Recap:** As discussed in [[W3 - Problem Framing#How Might We HMW Statements|Problem Framing]], HMW questions reframe problems into opportunities for design.
* **Role in Ideation:** They serve as prompts or launchpads for brainstorming sessions, encouraging a broad exploration of solutions.
* **Example:**
    * *Problem:* "Users are frustrated because they can't find contact information easily."
    * *HMW Statement:* "How might we make it easier for users to find contact information?"
    * This HMW then becomes the focus of an ideation session to generate various solutions.

### 2. Crazy 8s
* **What:** An individual brainstorming activity designed to generate a large number of ideas in a short amount of time.
* **Process:**
    1.  Each participant takes a sheet of paper and folds it into eight sections.
    2.  A timer is set (typically 5-8 minutes, meaning roughly 40-60 seconds per sketch).
    3.  Each participant sketches one distinct idea in each of the eight sections.
    4.  The goal is rapid idea generation, not perfect drawings. Focus on quantity over quality at this stage.
* **Benefit:** Pushes participants beyond their first, most obvious ideas and encourages exploration of diverse solutions. The time constraint helps to overcome creative blocks.
* **Outcome:** A wide array of high-level concepts that can then be shared, discussed, and built upon by the group.

### 3. Parallel Worlds (Analogous Inspiration)
* **What:** A "what if" technique to help think outside the box and overcome mental blocks by looking for inspiration in unrelated fields or contexts.
* **Process:**
    1.  Identify the core function or challenge of your problem.
    2.  Ask how other industries, products, services, or even nature solve similar core functions or challenges.
    * *Example:* "How might [a well-known innovative company like Apple or a completely different field like a Formula 1 pit crew] solve this problem?" or "What if this were a physical experience instead of digital?"
* **Goal:** To remove existing constraints from ideation, promote more expansive and novel ideas by drawing analogies from different domains.

## Storyboarding in UX

Storyboards are a visual storytelling tool used to convey ideas, user experiences, and the context of interactions in a sequential format, similar to a comic strip.

* **What:** A series of drawings or images arranged in sequence to visualize a user's interaction with a product or service over time, depicting key moments in their journey.
* **Why (Purpose in UX):**
    * **Visualize and Communicate Research & Insights:** Bring user scenarios, pain points, and potential solutions to life.
    * **Illustrate New Ideas Quickly:** A fast and effective way to sketch out and communicate a concept for a new feature or product flow.
    * **Identify Potential Pain Points Early:** By walking through a scenario, designers can anticipate where users might struggle.
    * **Communicate Ideas to Stakeholders:** Helps clients, investors, managers, and team members understand the intended user experience and the value of a design idea.
    * **Strengthen Empathy:** Focusing on real humans in real contexts through a narrative format reinforces empathy.
* **Who Uses/Benefits:** Designers use them to explore ideas; they can be shared with clients, stakeholders, and even customers for feedback.
* **How (Process):** Visually communicates, in a linear and sequential fashion, how a customer (persona) may interact with an experience or service to achieve a goal.

### Structure of a Storyboard
Typically follows a simple narrative arc:
* **Beginning:** Sets the context, introduces the persona and the problem or trigger.
* **Middle:** Shows the persona interacting with the product/service, key actions, and their emotional state. This is where the solution comes into play.
* **End:** Depicts the outcome, resolution of the problem, or the user achieving their goal.

### Elements in a Storyboard
Visuals can include:
* **Characters:** Representing the persona(s).
* **Backgrounds/Settings:** Showing the context of use.
* **Devices:** If it's a digital interaction.
* **Speech Bubbles/Thought Bubbles:** To convey dialogue or internal thoughts.
* **Captions/Annotations:** To explain actions or context.
* **Signs, Arrows, Office Furniture, Transportation Elements:** Any visual cues to make the story clear.

### Tips for Great Storyboards
* **Stay Authentic:** Focus on real human scenarios and contexts derived from research to strengthen empathy.
    * *Example:* "Tom lives alone. He is suffering from depression having just lost his job. He feels hopeless and alone." (Sets an authentic, empathetic context).
* **Keep it Simple (Edit, Edit, Edit):** Focus on the key moments and essential details. Don't overcomplicate the visuals or the narrative. Clarity is more important than artistic perfection.
* **Highlight Emotion:** Show the persona's feelings throughout the journey to build empathy and emphasize the impact of design choices.
    * *Example (from lecture slide showing an app to support someone with depression):* Visuals showing friends checking in, and Tom beginning to feel less disconnected.

### Storyboard Planning
Before drawing, plan key aspects:
* **Audience:** Who is the storyboard for? This influences the level of detail and style.
* **Key Message:** What is the main point you want to convey?
* **Story:** What is the beginning, middle, and end?
* **Places/Context:** Where and when does the story take place?
* **Campaign and Onboarding (if applicable):** How does the user discover/start using the service?
* **Desired Actions:** What do you want the viewer to understand or do after seeing the storyboard?
* **Tone of Voice:** What is the overall feeling (e.g., serious, humorous, aspirational)?
* **Goals (of the storyboard itself):** What do you aim to achieve with it?
* **Measuring Success (of the storyboard):** How will you know if it's effective (e.g., stakeholder understanding, useful feedback)?

Ideation is about exploring possibilities. These techniques help teams move from well-understood problems to a range of creative solutions, which can then be prototyped and tested in subsequent phases of the design process (as will be covered in [[Week 05 - Wireframing & Prototyping]]).
