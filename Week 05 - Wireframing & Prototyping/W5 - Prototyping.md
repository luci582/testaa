Prototyping is the process of creating an early, interactive model of a product or feature to test concepts, assumptions, and usability before investing in full-scale development. Prototypes transform static [[W5 - Wireframes|wireframes]] and [[W5 - Wireflows|wireflows]] into tangible, testable experiences. They are a key component of the "Develop" and "Deliver" (specifically, preparing for "Test") phases of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]].

## What is a Prototype?

* **Definition:** An early model, sample, or release of a product built to test a concept or process. In UX, prototypes are often interactive simulations of how an application or website will look and function.
* **Purpose:**
    * **Test Concepts & Assumptions:** Evaluate design ideas and underlying assumptions with users and stakeholders.
    * **Gather Feedback:** Collect insights on usability, user flow, and overall experience.
    * **Refine Ideas:** Identify areas for improvement and iterate on designs based on feedback.
    * **Communicate Design Vision:** Provide a tangible way to demonstrate how a product will work.
    * **Mitigate Risk:** Reduce the risk of releasing a flawed or poorly received solution by identifying problems early.
* **Key Characteristic:** **Testable.** Prototypes are meant to be interacted with to evaluate their effectiveness.

## Why Do We Prototype?

* **Simulate Digital Experience without Full Development:** Allows teams to create an interactive experience without writing full production code. This saves time and resources.
* **Test with Users Early and Often:** Facilitates early user testing throughout the design cycle, enabling iterative improvements.
* **Improve Usability:** By observing users interact with a prototype, designers can identify and fix usability issues.
* **Validate Design Decisions:** Helps confirm if design choices effectively meet user needs and business goals.
* **Facilitate Stakeholder Communication:** Makes it easier for stakeholders to understand and provide feedback on proposed designs compared to static wireframes.

## When to Use Interactive Prototypes?

* **Any Stage in Development Cycle:** Prototypes can be used at various points, from early concept exploration (low-fidelity) to late-stage usability testing (high-fidelity).
* **For INFS3700:** Prototyping is particularly relevant in the later stages of the design process (Develop/Deliver) as students move towards creating solutions for their individual assignments.

## Levels of Prototype Fidelity

Similar to [[W5 - Wireframes|wireframes]], prototypes can range in fidelity. The transcript for Week 5 mentions moving from concepts/wireframes to "clickable prototypes."

* **Low-Fidelity Prototypes:**
    * **Characteristics:** Basic, often made from paper sketches, simple digital wireframes linked together, or even physical mock-ups (like the "paper prototype" example shown in the lecture where hand-drawn screens are manually changed to simulate interaction).
    * **Focus:** Testing core concepts, information architecture, and basic user flows quickly and cheaply.
    * **Interactivity:** Can be simulated manually (e.g., a person acting as the "computer") or with very basic digital linking.
* **Medium-Fidelity Prototypes:**
    * **Characteristics:** Digitally created, often using wireframes with some level of interactivity (e.g., clickable buttons linking to other screens). More refined than paper prototypes but still lacking detailed visual styling.
    * **Focus:** Testing navigation, task completion, and more detailed interaction flows.
* **High-Fidelity Prototypes:**
    * **Characteristics:** Closely resemble the final look and feel of the product. Include detailed visual design, branding, content (or realistic placeholder content), and complex interactions. Often created with tools like Figma.
    * **Focus:** Usability testing, gathering feedback on visual design and overall user experience, and final validation before development handoff.
    * **Interactivity:** Highly interactive, with clickable elements, transitions, and sometimes even basic animations.
    * **Individual Assignment:** While wireflows are an option, creating a (likely medium to high-fidelity) clickable prototype in Figma is encouraged and often preferred for showcasing the final design solution. The lecture showed an example of a high-quality student prototype for a parking app.

## Spectrum of Prototyping Methods (from Lecture Discussion)

1.  **Concept Statements:** More informational, writing down concepts.
2.  **Utilizing Existing Solutions/Products:** To simulate and test ideas.
3.  **Low-Fidelity Prototypes (e.g., Paper Prototypes):** As described above. Useful for quick, cheap testing of core ideas.
4.  **Physical Models (e.g., Lego Prototypes):** Used for service staging or visualizing physical spaces and interactions. Not directly digital, but illustrates the concept of modeling an experience.
5.  **High-Fidelity Interactive Prototypes (Digital):** The primary focus for digital product design. This is what students will largely aim for in Figma.

## From Wireframes & Mockups to Prototypes

The lecture described a progression:

* **[[W5 - Wireframes|Wireframes]]:** Focus on structure and layout (low to medium fidelity).
* **Mockups:** Higher fidelity than wireframes, focusing more on visual design (colors, typography, imagery), bridging the gap between wireframes and prototypes. They are generally static.
* **Clickable Prototypes:** Bring mockups or high-fidelity wireframes to life by adding interactivity. Navigation becomes possible, buttons link to other pages, and users can simulate task completion. This allows for testing of flows and functions.
* **Live Site/Final Product:** The fully developed, coded, and launched product. Data from live use (e.g., via Google Analytics) can be used for benchmarking and further iteration.

## Prototyping Tools

* **Figma:** The primary tool emphasized in this course. It allows for designing interfaces and then adding interactivity to create clickable prototypes.
* **Other tools mentioned as historically used (now largely superseded by Figma for many):** InVision, Sketch (often used with InVision or other prototyping plugins).
* **Low-code/No-code platforms (e.g., Mendix):** Mentioned in the context of developing *actual applications* rather than just design prototypes, but distinct from design-focused prototyping tools like Figma.

## Key Takeaways for Prototyping

* **Purpose-Driven Fidelity:** Choose the prototype fidelity that matches your current goals (e.g., quick concept validation vs. detailed usability testing).
* **Iterative Process:** Prototyping is not a one-off activity. Create, test, learn, and iterate.
* **Focus on Interaction:** The key difference from static wireframes/mockups is the ability to interact and simulate the user experience.
* **Testability:** Prototypes are valuable because they are testable with users, providing crucial feedback for design refinement.
* **Communication:** An excellent tool for communicating design intent and functionality to stakeholders and developers.

For the individual assignment, creating an interactive prototype in Figma is a highly recommended way to demonstrate the proposed digital solution.
