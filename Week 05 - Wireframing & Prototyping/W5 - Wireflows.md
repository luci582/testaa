Wire flows are a UX design deliverable that visually represents a user's path through a series of screens or steps to complete a specific task within a digital product. They combine elements of [[W5 - Wireframes|wireframes]] (screen layouts) and flowcharts (process steps) to illustrate a user's journey and interactions.

## What is a Wire flow?

* **Definition:** A wire flow shows a sequence of screens (represented as wireframes) connected by arrows or lines indicating how a user moves from one step to the next to accomplish a particular goal or task.
* **Purpose:**
    * To visualize and document user paths and interactions.
    * To communicate the logic and flow of a user's journey through an application or website.
    * To help teams understand the sequence of screens required for key tasks.
    * To identify potential issues or complexities in a user flow early in the design process.
* **Combination:** Effectively merges wireframes (static screen layouts) with flowcharts (process steps), providing both screen context and flow logic.
* **Focus on User Movement:** Emphasizes how users navigate through the interface, not just the static layout of individual screens.

## Key Characteristics of Wireflows

* **Sequential:** Illustrates a logical, step-by-step progression through a task.
* **Screen-Based:** Uses simplified screen representations (wireframes) as the nodes in the flow.
* **Task-Oriented:** Typically focuses on a single user task or goal (e.g., "purchase a hoodie," "sign up for an account").
* **Basic Logic:** Outlines the primary pathway and key decision points.
* **Fidelity:** Can range from low-fidelity (hand-drawn sketches of screens connected by arrows) to medium-fidelity (digitally created basic wireframes in a flow). They are generally not high-fidelity visually.

## Wireflows vs. User Flows vs. Task Flows

These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but there can be subtle distinctions:

* **Task Flow:**
    * **Focus:** The steps a user takes to complete a specific task, often at a higher level of abstraction without detailed screen representations. It answers "What steps does the user take?"
    * **Representation:** Often a simple flowchart with actions or decisions, may not include screen visuals.
    * *Example (Purchase a hoodie):* Start → Product View → Select Size → Click Buy Now → Checkout → Shipping Info → Payment Info → Order Confirmation.
* **Wireflow:**
    * **Focus:** Combines the task flow with screen mockups (wireframes) for each step, showing *how* the user moves through the interface screens to complete the task.
    * **Representation:** A series of wireframes connected by arrows.
* **User Flow:**
    * **Focus:** Can be broader than a single task flow and may show more complex scenarios, including multiple decision points, branches, and alternative paths (not just the "happy path").
    * **Representation:** Can also use wireframes or more abstract diagrams. Often used to explore various ways a user might navigate through a system.
    * **Complexity:** Wireflows are often considered a more specific type of user flow that emphasizes the screen-by-screen progression for a primary task.

**For INFS3700:** The term "wireflow" is used to emphasize the combination of screen layouts with flow logic, typically focusing on the main pathway.

## Benefits of Using Wireflows

* **Clear Communication:** Effectively communicates the user's journey and interaction model to stakeholders, developers, and other team members, especially those less familiar with UX jargon.
* **Early Identification of Issues:** Helps to spot usability problems, dead ends, or awkward transitions in a flow before detailed design or development begins.
* **Focus on "Happy Path":** Wireflows often initially focus on the "happy path" or "happy scenario" – the ideal sequence of steps a user takes to successfully complete a task without errors or deviations. This helps establish the core functionality.
    * Once the happy path is defined, alternative paths or error states can be explored (often moving towards a more comprehensive user flow).
* **Planning for Development:** Assists developers in understanding the sequence of screens and interactions they need to build.
* **Documentation:** Serves as documentation for how key tasks are accomplished within the application.
* **Efficiency:** More useful for initial communication than complex user flows that show all possible pathways, which can be overwhelming for some stakeholders.

## Creating a Wireflow

1.  **Define the User Story/Goal:** Start with a clear user story or task the user needs to accomplish (e.g., "As a user, I want to find a fast way to buy a single piece of apparel").
2.  **Outline the Task Flow:** Break down the user's goal into a sequence of steps or actions.
3.  **Sketch/Wireframe Screens:** Create a basic [[W5 - Wireframes|wireframe]] for each key screen involved in the task flow. Focus on essential elements and layout.
4.  **Connect the Screens:** Use arrows or lines to show the progression from one screen to the next, indicating the user's path.
5.  **Add Annotations (Optional but Recommended):** Briefly explain key interactions, decisions, or changes on each screen or transition.
6.  **Iterate:** Review the wireflow with the team and stakeholders, and refine it based on feedback.

**Fidelity in Wireflows:**
* **Low-Fidelity:** Can be hand-drawn sketches of screens connected by arrows. This is excellent for rapid ideation and exploration. (Encouraged for initial stages of individual assignment).
* **Medium-Fidelity:** Digitally created wireframes (e.g., in Figma) connected to show the flow. These are cleaner and more suitable for presentation.

**Key Consideration:** Wireflows at this stage are typically *not* interactive (i.e., not clickable [[W5 - Prototyping|prototypes]]). They are static representations of a dynamic process. The interactivity comes later with prototyping.

Wireflows are an essential tool for translating user needs and task analyses into a visual plan for interface design, ensuring a logical and user-centered progression through key application tasks.
