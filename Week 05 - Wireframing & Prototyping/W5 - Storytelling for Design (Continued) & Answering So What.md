This note briefly touches upon the continued importance of storytelling in conveying design ideas and the crucial step of answering the "So What?" question – essentially, demonstrating the value and impact of UX research findings and design solutions. Due to time constraints in the lecture, this topic was mentioned as an area for potential discussion.

## Storytelling for Design (Continued)

* **Recap from [[W4 - Ideation Techniques#Storyboarding in UX|Week 4]]:** Storyboarding is a key technique for visually communicating user scenarios, pain points, and how a proposed design solution can help.
* **Ongoing Importance:** Storytelling remains vital throughout the design process, especially when presenting:
    * [[W3 - Personas|Personas]] (telling the story of your users).
    * [[W3 - Customer Journey Mapping|Customer Journey Maps]] (telling the story of the user's experience).
    * [[W5 - Prototyping|Prototypes]] (telling the story of how a user interacts with the future product).
* **Purpose:**
    * To make design concepts more relatable, memorable, and persuasive.
    * To build empathy among stakeholders for the user's experience.
    * To clearly illustrate the context in which a design solution will be used and the benefits it will provide.
    * To articulate the narrative of the design process itself – from problem discovery to solution.

## Answering the "So What?" – Demonstrating Impact and Value

After conducting research, analyzing data, and developing design concepts (like [[W5 - Wireframes|wireframes]] and [[W5 - Prototyping|prototypes]]), it's crucial to articulate the significance of these efforts. This involves answering the "So What?" question:

* **What does this mean?**
    * Clearly explain the key insights derived from user research.
    * Show how these insights have directly informed design decisions.
* **Why does this matter?**
    * Articulate the potential impact of the proposed design solutions on:
        * **The User:** How will it alleviate their pain points, meet their needs, and help them achieve their [[W1 - User Goals, Behaviour, and Context#1 User Goals|goals]]? How will it improve their experience?
        * **The Business:** How will it contribute to business objectives (e.g., increased engagement, higher conversion rates, improved customer satisfaction, reduced support costs)?
* **Connecting Findings to Solutions:**
    * Explicitly link the features and functionalities of your [[W5 - Prototyping|prototype]] or [[W5 - Wireflows|wireflow]] back to the specific user needs and pain points identified in your research (e.g., from your [[W3 - Affinity Mapping|affinity maps]], [[W3 - Personas|personas]], and [[W3 - Customer Journey Mapping|journey maps]]).
    * Provide a clear rationale for design choices, grounded in user data.
* **Communicating Value:**
    * This is especially important when presenting to stakeholders who need to understand the return on investment (ROI) of UX efforts.
    * Being able to answer "So what?" effectively justifies the design work and helps secure buy-in for further development and implementation.

While not extensively covered in the Week 5 lecture due to time, both storytelling and the ability to articulate the value ("So What?") of UX work are critical skills for UX professionals. They ensure that designs are not only user-centered but also understood and valued by the broader team and organization.
