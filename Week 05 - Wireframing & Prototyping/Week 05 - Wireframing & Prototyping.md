This week focuses on the crucial skills of visualizing digital applications through wireframes, wireflows, and prototypes. After defining problems and ideating solutions in the previous weeks, we now move into giving tangible form to these ideas. These representations are essential for communicating design concepts, testing usability, and guiding development. This stage is firmly within the "Develop" and "Deliver" (specifically, "Prototype" and preparing for "Test") phases of the [[W1 - The Design Process#2 The Double Diamond Model|Double Diamond]].

The lecture will cover the definition and purpose of wireframes and wireflows, different levels of fidelity (low, medium, high), the process of creating them, and their role in communication with stakeholders and developers. We will then explore prototyping, its importance in testing concepts, and various methods for creating prototypes, including the use of Figma.

## Key Topics for Week 5

This week's content is broken down into the following key areas:

* [[W5 - Visualizing Digital Applications]]: Discussing the importance of visual communication in UX design and how design sketches, wireframes, and wireflows help in proposing, exploring, refining, and communicating ideas.
* [[W5 - Wireflows]]: Understanding wireflows as a sequence of screens showing user progression through a task, focusing on main pathways ("happy paths") and their utility in communicating basic logic.
* [[W5 - Wireframes]]: Detailing wireframes as blueprints for individual screens, outlining layout, content hierarchy, and key UI elements, and discussing different levels of fidelity (low, medium, high).
* [[W5 - Prototyping]]: Exploring prototypes as interactive models created to test concepts, assumptions, and usability before full development. This includes the benefits of prototyping and different prototyping methods.
* [[W5 - Storytelling for Design (Continued) & Answering So What]]: Revisiting the role of storytelling in conveying design ideas and discussing how to leverage research findings to inform solutions. (Time permitting)

## Assignment Focus
* **Group Project Final Submission:** Due this Friday by 5 pm. This includes the PowerPoint presentation, FigJam link, and workshop recording link.
* **Week 6 Mid-Term Reflection:** Reminder about the upcoming personal reflection (individual or group retro) due in Week 7.
* **Figma:** Continued emphasis on using Figma for wireframing and prototyping, particularly relevant for the upcoming individual assignment. Tutorials this week will cover Figma for wireflows and sketching wireframes.
