This course, INFS3700, offers a comprehensive introduction to User Experience (UX) and Service Design (SD). The initial weeks (1-7) will focus on UX design, covering the principles and processes involved in creating user-centered digital products and services. The later part of the course (from Week 8 onwards) will shift focus to Service Design, exploring the holistic design of services considering all online and offline touchpoints.

The primary goal is to equip students with the skills to understand user needs, define problems, design effective solutions, prototype these solutions (notably using Figma), and iteratively test them within business process contexts.

## Overarching Themes & Core Competencies

Throughout this course, several key themes and competencies will be developed:

* **Human-Centered Design:** Emphasizing the critical importance of designing for the end-user's actual needs and experiences, rather than being driven by personal preferences or purely business objectives.
* **Problem Solving through Design:** Learning to utilize design thinking methodologies as a robust tool for identifying, analyzing, and solving complex problems.
* **Research & Analysis:** Developing skills in user research techniques such as interviews and workshops to gather insights into user behaviors, needs, and pain points.
* **Prototyping & Iteration:** Gaining practical experience in creating interactive prototypes and understanding the iterative nature of design based on feedback and testing.
* **Strategic Thinking:** Evolving from a design practitioner to a strategist who can leverage UX/SD principles to inform and influence business decisions and risk mitigation.
* **Workshop Facilitation:** A significant component involves learning to plan and run effective workshops to understand user problems and co-design solutions.

## Course Structure & Key Learning Areas

The course is structured to build knowledge progressively:

* **Foundations of UX:** Understanding core concepts, the distinction and relationship between UX, SD, and Customer Experience (CX).
* **Evaluating Design:** Learning to critically assess designs using established criteria, particularly heuristic evaluations.
* **Understanding Users:** Delving into user goals, behaviors, mental models, and the context in which they interact with products and services.
* **The Design Process:** Exploring structured approaches to design, such as the Double Diamond model and the broader Design Thinking framework.

## Career Relevance

The skills and knowledge gained in this course are highly relevant in the current job market, with strong demand for UX and Service Designers across a multitude of industries. This course aims to provide a stepping stone for students wishing to pursue careers in these dynamic fields.
